"No. I'm afraid not." -> No, sorry.


"Hmm - that's better - midway between the house and the oak. Yes - that must have been the one. I suppose it's impossible to find out how tall it was." -> Hmm, better - between the house and the oak. That must be it. Can't know its height now, I guess.


"Excellent! But how in --" -> Great! But how...


"Now then - the shadow of the oak is fairly obvious - we can see that for ourselves - but the shadow of the elm is a bit more difficult." -> The oak's shadow is clear, but the elm's shadow is trickier.


"A fishing rod of six feet -- throws a shadow -- of -- ah -- let me see -- nine feet exactly. Quite simple." -> A six-foot fishing rod casts a nine-foot shadow. Pretty straightforward.

I can reconstruct the scene fairly easily from the data we have on hand -- Rachel's condition -- the bag found in the lake -- the open door -- the muffler -- and the piece of wood used as a prop. It is the last which is particularly significant He had talked Rachel into assisting him -- realizing that the girl was still infatuated They waited until everyone had gone to bed -- then stole down here. It was a stormy night I believe----" -> He was killed the second night after you found him in the library. I can piece together the scene from the evidence - Rachel's state, the bag in the lake, the open door, the cloth, and the prop. The prop is crucial. He convinced Rachel to help because she still liked him. They sneaked down here after everyone slept, during a stormy night, I think.

"Try rubbing one of them -- that reddish one, for instance." -> Rub one of them, maybe the reddish one.

"It's hard for me to predict what the police will do, but personally I can see no alternative. The rat has bitten and killed one man, and severely poisoned another. The cause of death looks like strychnine poisoning. It seems obvious that if the rat bite did kill the man, the first thing to do is to dissect the rat and discover how it was able to deliver this lethal bite." -> I can't say what the police will do, but the rat killed one person and poisoned another. The symptoms match strychnine poisoning. If the rat caused the death, dissecting it could help understand how.


"We know it bit him." -> We know it attacked him.


"I never theorize. By the way, Mr. Jackson--being a zoologist you are naturally familiar with the Tamana... the Tamana... the Darjeeling snow bird?" -> I don't theorize. Mr. Jackson, as a zoologist, do you know the Darjeeling snow bird?

"Only what I've been reading in the papers. Apparently, she was past her prime, which was the more unfortunate as this Miss Dunbar, who superintended the education of the two young children, is reputed to be a very attractive young lady." -> I only know what the newspapers say. Miss Dunbar, who looked after the kids, seems to be attractive, but the deceased lady wasn't as young.

"I was trying to express it as delicately as possible, but - (CLEARS THROAT) - if you insist on the word I won't contradict you." -> I tried to be subtle, but if you want, I'll say it plainly.


"Don't be noisy, Mr. Gibson. Please, don't be noisy. I find that after breakfast even the smallest argument is unsettling. I suggest that a stroll in the morning air and a little quiet thought will be greatly to your advantage." -> Please, calm down, Mr. Gibson. Arguments, especially after breakfast, unsettle me. I suggest a walk and some quiet thinking would help.


"(CALLS) Good-morning, Mr. Gibson. You've a great deal yet to learn." -> (CALLS) Good morning, Mr. Gibson. You have much to understand yet.


"(STERN) I dislike liars, Watson, and I cannot tolerate arrogance -- particularly when it's coupled with great wealth." -> (STERN) I hate liars and arrogant people, especially if they're rich, Watson.


"I didn't. It was pure bluff." -> I didn't know. I was guessing.


"Oh, of course he will. He needs my help too badly. He'll probably change his mind before he's halfway down the stairs." -> He'll return. He needs my help. He'll change his mind soon.


"(CALLS) Come in! Ah! (CHUCKLES) Mr. Gibson. Just saying to Dr. Watson that I was certain you'd be back." -> (CALLS) Come in! Oh! (CHUCKLES) Mr. Gibson. I told Dr. Watson you'd return.


"Surely, that is for me to decide, Mr. Gibson." -> I'll decide that, Mr. Gibson.


"The truth." -> Tell me the truth.


"And then, I suppose, this young governess, Miss Dunbar, arrived on the scene." -> After that, did Miss Dunbar, the governess, come?


"Did you suggest marriage to her?" -> Did you propose to her?


"I see. Then you made an utterly insincere proposition to her." -> So, you insincerely proposed to her.


"It's only the young lady's sake that forces me to touch your case at all. Now, tell me, sir. What is your own opinion as to Miss Dunbar's guilt?" -> I'm only dealing with this for the young lady's sake. What's your opinion about Miss Dunbar's guilt?


"Pray continue, Mr. Gibson." -> Please, go on, Mr. Gibson.


"Well, that possibility has already occurred to me. It's the only obvious alternative to deliberate murder." -> I've thought about that possibility. It's the only clear option other than intentional murder.


"Mr. Gibson, I should like to examine your house and the scene of the murder as soon as possible." -> Mr. Gibson, I want to check your house and where the murder happened soon.


"Excellent! Watson, old fellow -- [?] the timetable! We're catching the next fast train to Winchester!" -> Great! Watson, check the timetable! We're taking the next fast train to Winchester!


"(CHUCKLES) I need not appear in the matter at all, Sergeant Coventry. If I can clear it up, I don't ask to even have my name mentioned." -> (CHUCKLES) I don't need to be involved, Sergeant Coventry. If I solve it, I don't even want my name mentioned.


"Yes, sergeant?" -> Yes, Sergeant?


"Then please ask it." -> Then, go ahead and ask.


"I've been considering that possibility." -> I've been thinking about that idea.


"One of a pair? Where's the other?" -> Is it one of a set? Where's the other one?


"We'll do that later." -> We'll handle that later.


"Ah! This, I presume, is Thor Bridge." -> Ah, I think this is Thor Bridge.


"I see. I gathered from the newspaper reports that the shot was fired at very close quarters." -> I see. I understood from the news that the shot was fired very close.


"Near the right temple, wasn't it?" -> Wasn't it near the right temple?


"Clutched, you say?" -> You say she was holding it tightly?


"Ah, that's of greatest importance. It excludes the idea that anyone could have placed the note there after death in order to furnish a false clue." -> That's very important. It means no one put the note there after death to mislead.


"Did Miss Dunbar admit writing it?" -> Did Miss Dunbar confess to writing it?


"What was her explanation?" -> What did she say about it?


"Yes, it seems odd that Mrs. Gibson was still clutching that note." -> Yes, it's strange that Mrs. Gibson was still holding onto that note.


"Hello!" -> Hey!


"(OFF) Did you notice this, sergeant?" -> (OFF) Did you see this, Sergeant?


"(OFF) Yes, but it's been done recently. Notice how the stonework is white just here. It took some violence to do that. Hand me your cane, Watson, will you?" -> (OFF) Yeah, but it's recent. See how the stonework is white here. It took some force. Pass me your cane, Watson, please?


"(OFF) Thanks." -> (OFF) Thanks.


"(OFF) Yes, it was a hard knock. (CLOSER) And in a curious place, too." -> (OFF) Yeah, it was a strong hit. (CLOSER) And in a strange spot, too.


"Well, perhaps it hasn't. But it's a point worth noting. There were no footprints, you say, sergeant?" -> Maybe it hasn't, but it's important to note. There were no footprints, right, Sergeant?


"That's a pity. Hmm. Well, sergeant, I'm much obliged to you and now I think we'll go back to the house." -> That's unfortunate. Well, Sergeant, thanks a lot. I think we'll return to the house now.


"Oh, uh, who is Cesar?" -> Oh, who is Cesar?


"Brazilian, eh? Like Mrs. Gibson?" -> Brazilian, huh? Like Mrs. Gibson?


"(LAUGHS) I'm delighted, sergeant. [Come, Watson, let's] get back to the house." -> (LAUGHS) Great, Sergeant. Let's return to the house, Watson.


"I see. And these are all the firearms in Mr. Gibson's possession, eh, Cesar?" -> I understand. These are all of Mr. Gibson's guns, right, Cesar?


"Did you ever witness physical violence towards Mrs. Gibson?" -> Did you ever see any physical violence towards Mrs. Gibson?


"Thank you, Cesar, that will be all." -> Thanks, Cesar. You can go now.


"I should agree with you if it were not for one fact -- the finding of the revolver in her wardrobe." -> I'd agree, but there's the revolver found in her closet.


"I think not, old chap." -> I don't think so, old friend.


"We must look for consistency. Where there is a want of it, we must suspect deception." -> We need consistency. If it's missing, we should suspect deception.


"No, no, my dear chap, I won't admit that's even possible. When a crime is coolly premeditated, then the means of covering it are coolly premeditated also." -> No, I won't believe that's possible. If a crime is carefully planned, so is the cover-up.


"I hope I can give you the answer to that question, Watson, when we've made one further visit." -> Hopefully, after another visit, I'll have an answer for you, Watson.


"To prison, old chap." -> We're going to prison, buddy.


"Yes, we're going to Winchester Prison to call on Miss Dunbar. I'm certain that the key to this strange mystery lies in her hands." -> Yeah, we're heading to Winchester Prison to visit Miss Dunbar. I think she holds the answer to this weird mystery.


"Miss Dunbar, tell us of your true relations with the dead woman." -> Miss Dunbar, explain your real relationship with the deceased woman.


"Please tell us exactly what happened on the evening of Mrs. Gibson's death." -> Tell us precisely what occurred on the night Mrs. Gibson died.


"Hmm. And yet she kept your reply very carefully. That's interesting. Tell me what happened when you met her that night." -> Interesting, she kept your response very carefully. Explain what occurred when you met her that night.


"And yet, presuming she met her death shortly after you left her, you heard no shot?" -> If she died soon after you left, you didn't hear a gunshot?


"Did you leave it again that night?" -> Did you leave it there again that night?


"This pistol that [was] found in your room. Had you ever seen it before?" -> The pistol found in your room—had you seen it before?


"Hm. You've no idea how long it had been there?" -> You don't know how long it was there?


"How do you know?" -> How are you so sure?


"I see. Then someone must have come into your room and placed the pistol there in order to incriminate you." -> So, someone must have entered your room and put the pistol there to frame you.


"Yes. Miss Dunbar, on examining the scene of Mrs. Gibson's death, I noticed that a piece of stonework on the underside of the parapet of the bridge had been broken away. Can you suggest any possible explanation for that?" -> Miss Dunbar, at the spot where Mrs. Gibson died, I saw a piece of stonework broken on the bridge's underside. Do you have an idea why?


"Possibly. But why should it appear at the very time of the tragedy, and at the very place? Could it possibly be that--? (THUNDERSTRUCK) Why, yes, of course! Idiot! Why didn't I think of it before?! Come along, Watson!" -> Maybe. But why did it happen at that time and place? Could it be that— (THUNDERSTRUCK) Oh, yes, of course! Fool! Why didn't I think of this before?! Come with me, Watson!


"Back to Thor Bridge, old fellow, as fast as we can get there!" -> Let's return to Thor Bridge quickly, old friend!


"The answer to this mystery I hope, my dear young lady. You will get news before the day is out. And meanwhile take my assurance that the clouds are lifting and that the light of truth is breaking through!" -> Hopefully, the answer to this mystery will come to light soon. I assure you that things are getting clearer.


"Tell you in a few moments. You got my message?" -> I'll tell you in a few moments. Did you get my message?


"You'll soon see, sergeant. Uh, Watson, I, uh, have some recollection that you usually go armed on these excursions of ours." -> You'll see soon, sergeant. Uh, Watson, I remember you usually carry a weapon on our outings.


"Give it to me, old chap, will you? Thanks. I believe your revolver may have a very intimate connection with the mystery we're investigating." -> Give me your gun, buddy. Thanks. I think your revolver might be closely linked to our investigation.


"No, Watson, I'm very serious. We have a test to make. If the test is successful, Miss Dunbar will be free before nightfall. And the test will depend on the conduct of this revolver of yours." -> No, Watson, I'm serious. We have a test. If it works, Miss Dunbar will be free soon. It depends on your revolver's behavior.


"I take the precaution of unloading it. Uh huh. There we are. Now, sergeant, ball of twine, please." -> I unloaded it to be safe. There. Now, sergeant, give me some twine, please.


"I tie one end of the twine -- like this -- to the handle of the revolver. So. Sergeant, see if you can find me a heavy stone, will you?" -> I'll tie one end of the twine—like this—to the revolver's handle. Like that. Sergeant, can you find me a heavy stone?


"Trying to reconstruct the killing of Mrs. Gibson. But you've seen me miss the mark before, Watson. I have an instinct for such things, and yet it has sometimes played me false." -> Trying to reconstruct how Mrs. Gibson was killed. But, Watson, I've made mistakes before. My instincts sometimes mislead me.


"It seemed a certainty when it first flashed across my mind in Miss Dunbar's cell, but one drawback of an active mind is that one can always conceive alternative explanations which would make our scent a false one. And yet-- Oh, well. We can but try." -> It felt certain at first in Miss Dunbar's cell. But an active mind always thinks of other explanations that might be wrong. Oh, well. Let's give it a try.


"Thank you, sergeant! Now! I tie the other end of this twine to a stone. Wait a minute. Like that. Splendid! Uh, sergeant, will you please take this stone and stretch the twine across the parapet of the bridge there -- so that the stone will swing just clear of the water on the other side of the bridge?" -> Thanks! Now, I'll tie the twine to a stone. Sergeant, can you stretch this across the bridge so the stone just misses the water on the other side?


"I'll stand on the spot where Mrs. Gibson's body was found. (CALLS) That's it, sergeant. Over the parapet." -> I'll stand where Mrs. Gibson was found. Sergeant, that's good. Over the bridge railing.


"Splendid! Now, Watson, watch closely. I raise the revolver to my head." -> Great! Now, Watson, watch carefully. I'll lift the revolver to my head.


"Don't worry, old chap, it's not loaded. Now, let us imagine I am the late Mrs. Gibson. I raise the revolver to my head and fire it." -> Don't worry, it's not loaded. Let's pretend I'm Mrs. Gibson. I'll aim the revolver at my head and pretend to fire.


"Instantly, my fingers release their grip and--" -> Then, my fingers let go and—


"There's your answer, Watson!" -> That's the answer, Watson!


"Was there ever a more exact demonstration? Come on, old fellow!" -> Wasn't that a clear demonstration? Let's go!


"Look at that! There's the second chip on the stonework of the parapet here -- same size as the first!" -> Look! There's another chip on the bridge railing—same as the first!


"Wasn't murder at all! It was suicide!" -> It wasn't murder—it was suicide!


"We can follow the various steps quite clearly. A note was extracted very cleverly from Miss Dunbar. A note which made it appear that she had chosen the scene of the crime. Mrs. Gibson, in her anxiety that the note should be discovered, somewhat overdid it by holding it in her hand to the last. That alone should have excited my suspicions earlier than it did." -> We can understand the steps easily. Miss Dunbar was deceived into writing a note that made her look guilty. Mrs. Gibson tried too hard to make sure the note was found by holding it till the end. I should've suspected something earlier because of that.


"Exactly! After discharging one of the cartridges, which she could easily do in the woods without attracting suspicion, she then went down to the bridge where she contrived this exceedingly ingenious method of getting rid of her weapon. When Miss Dunbar appeared, she used her last breath in pouring out her hatred, and then, when the girl had left, carried out her terrible purpose." -> Right! After firing one bullet in the woods quietly, she went to the bridge and cleverly disposed of the gun. She confronted Miss Dunbar, expressed her anger, and later, when the girl left, she did what she intended.


"You'll find it, with the aid of a grappling hook, at the bottom of the stream, and also the stone and the string, with which this vindictive woman attempted to disguise her own crime and fasten a charge of murder on an innocent victim." -> You'll find the gun, stone, and string at the bottom of the stream. That's how she tried to cover up her own crime and blame someone else for murder.


"Ah, I disagree, old chap. And I fear that you will not improve my reputation by adding the case of the Thor Bridge mystery to your annals." -> Sorry, I disagree. Adding the Thor Bridge case won't improve my reputation.


"Oh, no, it isn't, old boy. I've been sluggish in my mind -- and wanting in that mixture of imagination and reality which is the very basis of my art. I confess that the chip in the stonework was a sufficient clue to suggest the true solution, and I blame myself for not having attained it sooner." -> It's not like that, buddy. I've been slow and lacked the blend of imagination and reality crucial for my work. I should've seen the clue in the chip sooner.


"Oh? What was that, old fellow?" -> Oh? What's that, buddy?


"My dear Miss Tetfield, I found the true murderer of the Dowager Countess and he committed suicide. Surely the case has ended." -> I found the real killer of the Countess, and he killed himself. The case is closed, isn't it?


"Oh, yes, yes, yes. He was the heir to the title, wasn't he?" -> Yeah, he was going to inherit the title, right?


"Miss Tetfield, have you any direct news, any letter, from your fiancé since he left five years ago?" -> Miss Tetfield, have you heard directly from your fiancé since he left five years ago?


"Any clues as to his hiding place?" -> Any hints about where he's hiding?


"Oh." -> Oh, I see.


"Thank you." -> Thanks.
"There are quite a few grains of sand in-between the canvas and the frame here. Miss Tetfield, do you mind if I pry the canvas loose?" -> There's sand between the canvas and frame. Miss Tetfield, can I take the canvas off?


"Give me your pen knife, will you, Watson?" -> Can I have your pocket knife, Watson?


"Thanks, old chap." -> Thanks, buddy.


"Wait a minute. Here we are." -> Hold on. Found it.


"Uh huh. Look! The words "Sheriff" and "El Affroun" are stamped here. Sheriff is probably the framer's name and El Affroun is a town some fifty miles from Algiers. (DECISIVE) That settles it. Miss Tetfield, I accept your case. Watson and I will go to Africa and try to find your fiancé, Douglas Milton." -> Yes! There are names stamped here. "Sheriff" might be the framer's name, and "El Affroun" is a town near Algiers. That's it. Miss Tetfield, I'll help. Watson and I will go to Africa to find your fiancé, Douglas Milton.


"Well, Colonel De Brisson, I am trying to trace an Englishman who has been missing during the past four years. I've reason to believe that he might have joined the Legion." -> Colonel De Brisson, I'm looking for an Englishman missing for four years. I think he might be in the Legion.


"And he is, I would say, about three inches shorter than Douglas Milton -- and men do not shrink in the Foreign Legion, eh, Colonel?" -> He's about three inches shorter than Douglas Milton. Men don't shrink in the Legion, right, Colonel?


"Unless it's the one who died of dysentery. Colonel De Brisson, how would you advise us to set about trying to find a deserter?" -> Except if it's the one who died. Colonel De Brisson, how should we find a deserter?


"Oh? And what's that place?" -> Oh? What's that?


"Then that's our destination, Watson." -> That's where we're going, Watson.


"We shall be very cautious, I assure you. Goodbye, Colonel De Brisson, and thank you for your help." -> We'll be careful. Goodbye, Colonel De Brisson. Thanks for your help.


"It's ramifications are even more extensive than those you've mentioned." -> It has bigger consequences than you've said.


"I assure you, I'm not, old fellow." -> I promise I'm not, buddy.


"My old friend Duemmel is Chief of Police in Algiers. When I told him our mission, he advised me to come here. A five-hundred-franc note and the proprietor can obtain any and all information regarding the underworld. For as little as two hundred francs, he can arrange a murder. So that gives you some idea of the relative values in the Casbah." -> My friend Duemmel, the Chief of Police, suggested this place. With five hundred francs, the owner can get all underworld info. For two hundred francs, he can set up a murder. That tells you the value here.


"Oh, yes, yes, a charming scoundrelly fellow by the name of Rafi. I gave him five hundred francs and asked him to set his underworld grapevine in motion to see whether an Englishman living in hiding here in the Casbah could be found." -> Yes, Rafi, a tricky guy. Gave him five hundred francs to find an Englishman hiding here.


"Here comes Rafi now. Let's hope he has news for us. (CALLS) Here we are, Rafi! Come sit down, won't you?" -> Rafi's coming. Hope he has news. (CALLS) Hey Rafi! Sit here, okay?


"My friend knows that you're working with me. What have you found out?" -> My friend knows we're working together. What did you find?


"(CHUCKLES)" -> (LAUGHS)


"Uh, you have news for me, then?" -> So, got news?


"Good. What is it?" -> What is it?


"But I gave you five hundred francs. You said that you'd do the job for that." -> I gave you five hundred francs for the job.


"(CHUCKLES)" -> (LAUGHS)


"(CHUCKLES)" -> (LAUGHS)


"There you are." -> There you go.


"(CHUCKLES) I see." -> (LAUGHS) Got it.


"And if I refuse?" -> What if I say no?


"(LAUGHS) You're a scoundrel, Rafi." -> (LAUGHS) You're tricky, Rafi.


"Here's your money. (LOW) The information?" -> Here's your money. (QUIETLY) Got the info?


"A girl named Ayisha, in the Café of a Thousand Sighs?" -> Ayisha in the Café of a Thousand Sighs?


"(CHUCKLES) Thank you, thank you, yes. I - I think we can manage by ourselves, Rafi." -> (LAUGHS) Thanks. We'll manage, Rafi.


"Thank you, Rafi, thank you. I have a feeling that time will not weigh heavily on our hands. Good night." -> Thanks, Rafi. I think we'll be busy. Good night.


"(CHUCKLES) I quite agree, old chap, but he is amusing." -> (LAUGHS) I agree, buddy. He's funny.


"(LAUGHS) Oh, ho ho! Watson, you're incorrigible. But I think-- (STOPS SHORT) Watson?" -> (LAUGHS) Oh, Watson, you're funny! But— (STOPS) Watson?


"Look at the man sitting over in the corner by himself." -> Look at that guy in the corner.
"Of course we have. His name is Oliver Leaming. We met him at the inquest on the Montrevor case." -> Yes, we've met him. His name's Oliver Leaming. We saw him at the Montrevor case inquest.


"Not on a holiday, I'm sure. Mr. Oliver Leaming, if you recall, is a cousin of Douglas Milton's, the man we're searching for. If Milton were ever declared legally dead, Mr. Leaming over there would inherit the title." -> I don't think it's for vacation. Oliver Leaming is Douglas Milton's cousin, the one we're looking for. If Milton was legally declared dead, Leaming would get the title.


"That's true, old fellow. Come on, let's go and talk to the gentleman." -> Yes, that's right. Let's go talk to him.


"(CHEERFUL GREETING) Mr. Oliver Leaming! How very odd to meet you here!" -> (HAPPY GREETING) Hi, Mr. Oliver Leaming! Surprised to see you here!


"Thank you." -> Thanks.


"(CHUCKLES) Very considerate of you, I'm sure. Why are you here, Mr. Leaming?" -> (LAUGHS) Nice of you, but why are you here, Mr. Leaming?


"(LIGHTLY) It seems peculiar that you should be on a business trip here. Are you planning on opening a publishing house in Algiers? Or are you searching the Casbah for new authors?" -> (CASUALLY) Strange to be on a business trip here. Are you starting a publishing house in Algiers? Or looking for authors in the Casbah?


"(MORE SERIOUS) Mr. Leaming, why don't you admit that you're here for the express purpose of trying to find your cousin Douglas Milton?" -> (SERIOUS TONE) Mr. Leaming, why not admit you're here to find your cousin Douglas Milton?


"Yes, Mr. Leaming, we know that fact." -> Yes, we know that, Mr. Leaming.


"I believe not, Watson. I think he labors under the whimsical belief that the best method of discounting the truth is to state it baldly so that it will not be believed." -> No, Watson. He thinks stating the truth so bluntly makes it unbelievable.


"Yes, old chap, we must. I am sure that we're entrants in a race against death. We must get back to the hotel and into our disguises as quickly as possible. After that, we shall visit a young lady named Ayisha in the Café of a Thousand Sighs. And I am certain, Watson, that it will be the first time two men have ever entered the Casbah for the express purpose of preventing a murder!" -> Yes, we have to. We're racing against time. Let's go back to the hotel, disguise ourselves, and then visit Ayisha at the Café of a Thousand Sighs. I'm sure it's the first time two men went to the Casbah to stop a murder!


"Yes, Oliver Leaming -- with a knife between his shoulders." -> Yes, Oliver Leaming was stabbed.


"What can they do? Remember, there is no law in the Casbah. In any case, this man is beyond our help. Our job is to protect the living. Come on, old fellow, let's go to the Café of a Thousand Sighs and find this girl, Ayisha -- the girl Rafi says sings like a nightingale." -> What can they do? No laws in the Casbah. Anyway, we can't help him now. Our job is to protect the living. Let's go find Ayisha at the Café of a Thousand Sighs. Rafi says she sings beautifully.


"(LOW) Don't forget our role of tourist and guide, old chap. (ADOPTS ACCENT) Master? Would wish to meet this Ayisha?" -> (QUIETLY) Don't forget our act as tourists. (IN ACCENT) Sir? Want to meet Ayisha?


"(ACCENT) I will see if it can be arranged, master. (LOW) Wait here for me, Watson. I'll see what I can do." -> (IN ACCENT) I'll check, sir. (QUIETLY) Wait here, Watson. I'll see.


"(ACCENT) Mademoiselle Ayisha?" -> (IN ACCENT) Miss Ayisha?


"(ACCENT) There is an Englishman at the table over there. He wishes to talk to Ayisha." -> (IN ACCENT) An Englishman at that table wants to talk to Ayisha.


"(ACCENT) The man who sits at the table in the corner. He is very rich, Ayisha, and he admires you a great deal. He told me to give you this five-hundred-franc note." -> (IN ACCENT) The rich man in the corner likes you a lot. Gave me this five-hundred-franc note for you.


"(ACCENT) Good, Ayisha. I fetch him." -> (IN ACCENT) Good. I'll get him.
"Mr. Milton, do you know Oliver Leaming?" -> Mr. Milton, have you met Oliver Leaming?


"A toast to the new Earl of Montrevor." -> Let's toast the new Earl of Montrevor.


"Since you feel that way about it, Mr. Milton, why go? You can claim the title and the revenues of the estate without leaving Algeria. You could stay here and live on the income." -> If that's how you feel, Mr. Milton, why leave? You can get the title and estate income in Algeria and live here.


"Oh, yes, I'm quite certain of it." -> Yes, I'm very sure about it.


"But if you doubt my word, I suggest we all adjourn to the British consulate in Algiers. They can put you straight on the matter." -> If you don't trust me, let's all go to the British consulate in Algiers. They can clarify things for you.


"It's a bloody path that leads to the Montrevor title, sir. I suggest that we see that this poor girl's body is taken care of. And then go to the British consulate without any further delay." -> It's a complicated journey to the Montrevor title. Let's ensure the girl's body is taken care of, then go to the British consulate immediately.


"Now that we're at the consulate, Mr. Milton, I suggest that you swear on oath that you are Douglas Milton, heir to the Montrevor estate -- this gentleman is a commissioner of oaths -- then we can go in and see the consul." -> At the consulate, Mr. Milton, I suggest you swear under oath that you're Douglas Milton, the heir to Montrevor estate. This man is a commissioner of oaths, and then we can talk to the consul.


"Yes, certainly." -> Yes, of course.


"Not yet, my friend. Watson, this man is not Douglas Milton." -> Not yet, my friend. Watson, this man isn't Douglas Milton.


"There is no law in the Casbah, sir, so you cannot be punished for the two murders you committed there. But now that your avarice has tempted you here to Algiers where you've been foolish enough to sign a false statement, I think we can at least settle you very nicely for desertion, false impersonation, forgery and perjury." -> There's no law in the Casbah, so you won't be punished for the murders there. But since you signed a false statement in Algiers due to your greed, you'll be charged for desertion, impersonation, forgery, and perjury.


"The story should be obvious, old fellow. Oliver Leaming did track down the deserter. Recognition was uncertain after so many years, but at least it gave this gentleman the idea of impersonating the real Douglas Milton, a friend of his." -> The story is clear. Oliver Leaming found the deserter. They weren't sure about recognition after so long, but it gave this man the idea to impersonate the real Douglas Milton, his friend.


"The real Douglas Milton died of dysentery two years ago in Sidi Rached. As soon as the idea of impersonating Milton was born, Leaming had to die." -> The real Douglas Milton died of dysentery two years ago in Sidi Rached. Once they thought of impersonating Milton, Leaming had to be killed.


"Very simply, my dear sir. Douglas Milton was a painter -- a painter who excelled in the use of vivid colors. You, sir, suffer from the quite common malady of red-green color blindness. Less than an hour ago, you mistook a glass of port, which is red, for a glass of crème de menthe, which is green. I knew at once that you were an impostor." -> Simply put, sir, Douglas Milton was a painter who used vivid colors. You have red-green color blindness. You mistook a red glass for a green one. That's how I knew you were an imposter.


"(CALM) No, no, Watson. Don't go after him." -> (CALMLY) No, Watson, don't chase him.

"(FADES IN) Marriage suits you, Watson. You look in splendid shape." -> (BEGINS) Marriage looks good on you, Watson. You look great.


"And in practice again, I see. You didn't tell me that you'd gone back into harness." -> Back to work, I see. You didn't mention you were working again.


"Elementary, my dear chap. If a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver on his right forefinger and a bulge on the left side of his hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I should be dull, indeed, if I didn't pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession." -> Simple, my friend. If a man comes in smelling of iodoform, with silver nitrate on his finger and a bulge from his stethoscope in his hat, he's clearly a doctor.


"It's in a German-speaking country in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad." -> "It's in a German-speaking place in Bohemia, close to Carlsbad."


"Undoubtedly. And the man who wrote the note is a German." -> "Definitely. The person who wrote the note is German."


"Observe the curious construction of the sentence, 'This account of you we have from all quarters received.' A Frenchman or a Russian could not have written that. It's the German who is so discourteous to his verbs." -> "Notice how unusual the sentence structure is: 'This account of you we have from all quarters received.' A French or Russian person wouldn't phrase it like that. It's typical of the German language, being abrupt with verbs."


"No, no, no, no -- unless you have to." -> "No, not unless necessary."


"Then, my dear chap, stay by all means. I'm lost without my Boswell, and this promises to be interesting. I told Mrs. Hudson to let the masked visitor come upstairs unannounced." -> "Then, stay if you want. I need my assistant, and this seems interesting. I asked Mrs. Hudson to let the visitor in without announcing."


"Good evening, sir." -> "Good evening."


"Yes, indeed. Come in, won't you, and sit down?" -> "Yes, please, come in and have a seat."


"This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. You may say anything before him that you can say to me. Whom have I the honor to address?" -> "This is my friend, Dr. Watson. You can speak freely in front of him. Who am I speaking to?"


"I was well aware of that fact, sir." -> "I knew that already."


"That had not escaped me either, sir. In fact, if you will state your case, I shall be better able to advise you -- your Majesty." -> "I noticed that as well. Please explain your situation, your Majesty, so I can help you better."


"Why, indeed?" -> "Why is that?"


"Then, pray consult." -> "So, go ahead."


"Look her up in the index for me, will you, Watson? It's right beside you on the desk there." -> "Can you find her in the index, Watson? It's on the desk next to you."


"Splendid. Hand me the file, old chap. Thank you." -> "Great. Pass me the file, thank you."


"Was there a secret marriage?" -> "Was there a hidden wedding?"


"No legal papers or certificates?" -> "No official documents?"


"Then I fail to follow, your Majesty. If this young lady should produce her letters for blackmailing purposes, how is she to prove their authenticity?" -> "I'm confused, your Majesty. How can she prove the letters' authenticity if she uses them for blackmail?"


"Stolen." -> "Taken without permission."


"Imitated." -> "Copied."


"Bought." -> "Purchased."


"Oh, dear me. Yes, that's very bad. Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion." -> "Oh my, that's not good. Your Majesty made a mistake."


"Perhaps if you were to pay enough, the photograph might be bought." -> "Maybe if you pay a lot, you could buy the photograph."


"Stolen, then." -> "Taken without permission, right."


"Oh, dear, it's quite a pretty little problem." -> "Oh, it's a complicated issue."


"How, sir?" -> "How so?"


"And Irene Adler threatens to send the photograph to your fiancée, I suppose?" -> "Does Irene Adler threaten to send the photo to your fiancée?"


"And why?" -> "Why is that?"


"Splendid! Then we still have three days. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the present?" -> "Great! So, we have three days left. Your Majesty, will you stay in London for now?"


"Just two questions before you leave." -> "Two more questions before you go."


"Is the photograph large or small?" -> "Is the photo big or small?"


"I see. And what is Irene Adler's London address, please?" -> "Okay. What's Irene Adler's address in London?"


"Thank you, your Majesty. Good night, and I trust that we shall soon have some good news for you." -> "Thank you, your Majesty. Good night. Hopefully, we'll have good news for you soon."


"You can, my dear chap. I shall be glad of your company." -> "Sure, you can. I'd like your company."


"A good night's rest. We'll meet here at ten o'clock tomorrow morning." -> "Get a good night's sleep. Let's meet here at ten tomorrow morning."


"Then, my dear fellow, we will see what we can find out about Miss Irene Adler, late of the Warsaw Imperial Opera Company and at present residing at Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John's Wood." -> "So, let's find out about Miss Irene Adler. She used to work at the Warsaw Imperial Opera and lives at Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John's Wood."


"No. A bijou residence that represents the essence of dignified suburbia, but tells us very little about the owner. I think a visit to the local public house might prove more instructive. Come on, old chap. I see the door of the Coach and Horse is inviting us from across the road." -> "No, the house looks nice but doesn't reveal much about the owner. Let's go to the nearby pub. Follow me, I see the Coach and Horse door across the road."


"[That's why] I suggested them. In the character of a couple of stable hands, I felt that we might inspire confidence. This is a horsy neighborhood, and there's a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among their fraternity. Here we are. Better let me do most of the talking." -> "That's why I suggested this. As stable hands, I thought we could gain trust. This area loves horses, so they might be more open to us. Here's the pub. Let me lead the conversation."


"Let's go in, shall we?" -> "Shall we enter?"


"(COCKNEY) 'Alf a bowl of malt, please. 'Ow 'bout you, Charley?" -> "(COCKNEY ACCENT) Half a bowl of malt, please. What about you, Charley?"


"(COCKNEY) Have a drink wiv us, governor?" -> "(COCKNEY ACCENT) Want to have a drink with us, boss?"


"(COCKNEY) Oh, yes. We just come over from Clapham." -> "(COCKNEY ACCENT) Yeah, we just came from Clapham."


"(COCKNEY) Yes, that's right. We was told that Miss Adler across at Briony Lodge needed a new coachman and groom." -> "(COCKNEY ACCENT) Yeah, we heard Miss Adler at Briony Lodge needed a new coachman and groom."


"(COCKNEY) No, not yet. We thought we'd find out something about the old girl first." -> "(COCKNEY ACCENT) Nope, not yet. We wanted to learn something about the lady first."


"(COCKNEY) Oh. What's she like?" -> "(COCKNEY ACCENT) Oh. What kind of person is she?"


"(COCKNEY) Oh, she ain't married, you say?" -> "(COCKNEY ACCENT) Oh, she's not married, you're saying?"


"(COCKNEY) Sounds like a nice, cushy job to me. (TO WATSON) Come on, Charley, let's get over to the house and see what's what. (TO BARTENDER) Much obliged to you, chum." -> "(COCKNEY ACCENT) Sounds like an easy job to me. (TO WATSON) Let's go, Charley, check out the house. (TO BARTENDER) Thanks a lot, mate."


"Let's stroll back to Briony Lodge, shall we? I'm undecided whether to continue my investigations there or to try and find out something about Mr. Geoffrey Norton, the barrister. If he is just her lawyer and nothing else, it's more than likely that she's entrusted the photograph to his safekeeping." -> "Let's walk back to Briony Lodge, okay? I'm not sure if I should keep investigating there or find out about Mr. Geoffrey Norton, the barrister. If he's only her lawyer, she might have given him the photo."


"Hurry, Watson. It may be Mr. Norton's." -> "Quick, Watson. It might belong to Mr. Norton."


"(LOW) Yes! And here comes a man hurrying down the pathway. Quick -- behind this post. Listen!" -> "(LOW VOICE) Yes! Someone's coming down the path fast. Hide behind this post and listen!"


"Miss Adler's, no doubt! (LOW) Here she comes down the pathway. Back again behind the post, Watson!" -> "It's Miss Adler! (LOW VOICE) Here she comes down the path. Quick, hide behind the post again, Watson!"


"The game's afoot! Quick, we must get a cab and follow them!" -> "Let's go! We need a cab to follow them!"


"Here's half a sovereign for you, my man! The Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road, and another half sovereign for you if you get us there in twenty minutes!" -> "Here's half a coin! Take us to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. I'll give you the other half if we're there in twenty minutes!"


"(FADES IN) Watson! Watson, have they left? Splendid. Then come on -- we can return to Baker Street." -> "(BECOMES AUDIBLE) Watson! Have they gone? Great. Let's go back to Baker Street."


"They were married." -> "They got married."


"Of course. The ceremony would have been illegal if performed after noon. That accounted for their wild dash to the church. Jump into the cab, old fellow." -> "Right. After noon, the wedding would've been illegal. That's why they hurried to the church. Get in the cab, buddy."


"Two Twenty-One B, Baker Street." -> "221B Baker Street."


"Yes. And it may amuse you to know that I acted as witness at the ceremony." -> "Yeah. It might be amusing to know I was a witness."


"(LAUGHS) Their own witness had failed to appear and I was dragged into the breach. The bride gave me this sovereign as a memento. I, uh, think I'll wear it on my watch-chain in memory of the occasion." -> "(LAUGHS) Their witness didn't show, and I got pulled in. The bride gave me this coin. I might wear it on my watch-chain as a memory."


"You must leave that to me. I've already made my arrangements. There is only one point on which I must insist -- you must not interfere, come what may. You understand?" -> "Let me handle this. I've planned everything. Just one thing - don't get involved, no matter what. Got it?"


"Yes. There will be some small unpleasantness. Don't join in. It will end in my being conveyed into the house. As soon as I am able to, I shall open one of the windows. You are to watch from outside. When I raise my hand, you will throw an object -- that I shall give you -- through the window and, at the same time, cry 'Fire!' You follow me?" -> "Right. Something might happen, but don't get involved. I'll be taken into the house. Once I open a window, you'll be outside. When I signal, throw the object I give you through the window and shout 'Fire!' Understand?"


"Oh, it's nothing very formidable. Here it is. An ordinary plumber's smoke-rocket, fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your task is confined to throwing it through the window. When you raise the cry of fire, it will be taken up by quite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of the street, and I'll rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope I've made myself clear." -> "It's nothing serious. Here's what it looks like. It's a smoke-rocket for plumbers. It lights itself. Just throw it through the window. When you shout 'Fire!', others will join in. Walk to the end of the street and wait for me. Hope that's clear."


"Good. And now, old fellow, as soon as I've donned my clerical attire, let's be on our way. There's no time to be lost." -> "Great. Once I put on my clergy clothes, let's go. We can't waste time."


"I'm sure she will." -> "She'll do it, no doubt."


"All part of my conspiracy, old chap. You'll see them play their parts in a few minutes." -> "It's all planned. You'll see it happen soon."


"Yes. It's most unlikely that she carries it about with her. Remember, the king told us it was a large, framed picture. And also remember that she planned to use it within a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands on it. It must be inside her house." -> "Yeah. It's unlikely she carries it. The king said it's a big framed picture. She'd need it soon. It's probably in her house."


"Oh, psh! They didn't know how to look." -> "They didn't know where to search."


"I won't. I'll get her to show me." -> "I won't search. I'll ask her to reveal it."


"She won't be able to--" -> "She won't manage to..."


"Shh! Here comes the carriage now. Remember, Watson -- carry out my orders to the letter." -> "Shh! The carriage is here. Remember, do exactly as I told you."


"(AS THE CLERGYMAN) Move out of the way, please, and let the lady through." -> "(AS THE CLERGYMAN) Excuse me, please, make way for the lady."


"I'll - I'll tell you what-- (HAUGHTY) Stop molesting the lady, please!" -> "I'll - I'll tell you what-- (HAUGHTY TONE) Stop bothering the lady, please!"


"No, but I know where it is. She showed me, as I told you she would." -> "No, but I know where it is. She showed me, just like I said she would."


"There's no mystery, old chap. When my accomplices started the row in the street, I had a little moist red paint in my hand. My good friend Alfie pretended to strike me; I clapped my hand to my head and fell down. It's an old trick." -> "No mystery. When my friends caused the disturbance, I had red paint in my hand. My friend Alfie acted like he hit me; I pretended to be hurt. It's a known trick."


"My dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes. You really did it very well. Until after the fire alarm, I had no suspicion. But then, when I realized how I had betrayed myself, I began to think. I had been warned that if the King employed an agent he would certainly employ you. May I congratulate you on your disguise as a dear, old clergyman." -> "Dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes, you did a great job. I didn't suspect until after the fire alarm. But then I understood my mistake. I was warned that if the King got an agent, it'd be you. Nice work on your old clergyman disguise."


"My husband and I both thought that the best recourse was flight, so you will find the nest empty. As to the photograph of the King and myself, his Majesty may rest in peace." (TO HIMSELF) Oh, thank goodness for that. (READS) "I love and am loved by a better man than he. I leave another photograph, however, that he might care to possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes, very truly yours, Irene Norton, née Adler." -> "My husband and I left because we thought it was best. You'll find our home empty. As for the photo of the King and me, don't worry. I'm loved by someone better. I left another photo for him. Yours truly, Irene Norton, previously Adler."


"What a woman, Watson; what a woman; what a magnificent woman! She fooled me completely!" (CATCHES HIMSELF) But-- Oh. I, uh-- I'm sorry, your Majesty, I - I've been unable to bring your business to a more successful conclusion. -> "Wow, Watson, what a woman! She tricked me completely! Oh, sorry, your Majesty, I couldn't help you more."


"Your Majesty has something that I should value even more highly." -> "Actually, Your Majesty, there's something I'd value even more."


"This photograph, sir." -> "It's this photo, sir."


"Oh no, no, no, your Majesty. This is something I shall treasure all my life. This and a golden sovereign I received from the lady's hand. They will remind me that I was once tricked by a woman! A woman that I shall never forget." -> "No, Your Majesty, this means a lot to me. This photo and a gold coin from her will always remind me of being tricked by a woman, one I'll never forget."


"(CHUCKLES) Doesn't he, Mrs. Hudson? Try the beard on, Watson old chap." -> "(CHUCKLES) Doesn't he, Mrs. Hudson? Watson, try the beard on."


"Oh, don't worry, old chap. I shall spend a profitable evening writing on my new monograph." -> "Don't worry, I'll spend my evening writing."


"An analysis of teeth marks on pipe stems, with particular regard to indicated character." -> "I'm analyzing teeth marks on pipes, focusing on character clues."


"(CHUCKLES) Don't forget your sack of presents, old fellow." -> "(CHUCKLES) Don't forget your bag of gifts."

"And I hope your party is a great success, Mrs. Hudson." -> "I hope your party goes well, Mrs. Hudson."


"Oh, no, no, no; indeed, no, Mrs. Hudson. I can show the gentlemen out myself. You go off and have a good time." -> "No, no, Mrs. Hudson. I'll see them out. You go enjoy yourself."


"(INTERRUPTS) No, no, please, my dear fellow; certainly not." -> "(INTERRUPTS) No, please, not at all."


"You've far more important work to do. Widecombe probably wants his revenge at chess or something equally innocuous. Off with you, my dear fellow, and enjoy yourself." -> "You have more important things to do. Widecombe might want a game of chess. Go on, enjoy yourself."


"I shall be there. (CALLS) Uh, come on up, Widecombe!" -> "I'll join. (CALLS) Come up, Widecombe!"


"(CHUCKLES) Yes, Widecombe. I'm glad you came over to see me." -> "(CHUCKLES) Yes, Widecombe, good to see you."


"What's it to be? An evening of chess? Or have you unearthed some recent treasure of medieval pottery that we can discuss?" -> "What's it today? Chess or did you find some ancient pottery?"


"(CHUCKLES) Oh, come now, Widecombe. Don't tell me that after all these years of quiet friendship, you're going to become a client." -> "(CHUCKLES) Oh, come on, Widecombe. You're not going to be a client after all these years of friendship, are you?"


"(CHUCKLES) Oh, thanks." -> "(CHUCKLES) Oh, thanks."


"Ah. (PUFFS ON CIGAR) Now, my dear Widecombe, what's your trouble?" -> "Alright. (TAKES A PUFF ON CIGAR) So, Widecombe, what's the matter?"


"(CHUCKLES, HIGHLY AMUSED) Oh, my dear fellow, I've adopted many disguises in my time, but Father Christmas has never been one of them. Why do you want me to attend your party in disguise in any case? Are you ashamed of your friendship with a private detective or do you consider my features more acceptable when buried beneath the depths of a snowy beard?" -> "(CHUCKLES, AMUSED) Oh, I've worn many disguises, but never as Father Christmas. Why do you want me to come in disguise? Are you embarrassed about being friends with a detective, or do you prefer me hidden under a snowy beard?"


"Of course you're not, of course you're not. You, uh-- You want me to attend your party in disguise. Why?" -> "You're not, I see. You want me to come in disguise. Why?"


"(CHUCKLES) Dear me. Where are these presents now?" -> "(CHUCKLES) Oh my. Where are these gifts now?"


"Warning letter, eh?" -> "A warning letter?"


"Let me see that note, Widecombe, will you?" -> "Let me see that note, Widecombe."


"Thanks. (EXAMINING PAPER) Mm hm. Plain paper, torn from a penny notebook. Writing is obviously disguised and it-- (EXCITED) By George, yes! Widecombe -- I accept the case! I'll come with you to your party at once and, furthermore, I shall follow your suggestion regarding a disguise. Dressed as Santa Claus, I shall be less likely to attract suspicion." -> "Thanks. (LOOKING AT PAPER) Ah, yes. Simple paper, torn from a cheap notebook. The writing is clearly disguised and... (EXCITED) By George, yes! Widecombe, I'll take the case! I'll go to your party immediately, and I'll follow your idea about disguising myself. As Santa Claus, I'll stand out less."


"This writing, my dear fellow, this writing. Though it's in a false hand, I'd know that characteristic "M" in "My dear Widecombe." I've seen it too often at the beginning of a signature. Moriarty!" -> "The handwriting, my friend. Even in disguise, I recognize that "M" in "My dear Widecombe." I've seen it in many signatures. Moriarty!"


"Oh, one of the cleverest and most unscrupulous criminals in England. Widecombe, there's no time to be lost. It's -- let me see now -- six-thirty, half an hour beyond the deadline given you in this letter. We must go to your house at once." -> "He's one of England's smartest and most deceitful criminals. Widecombe, we need to hurry. It's - let's see - six-thirty, thirty minutes past the letter's deadline for you. We need to go to your house immediately."


"Thirty-Nine Bronson Square, eh? (MUSES) And dear old Watson is just around the corner in Lexington Gardens and hasn't any idea that I've left Baker Street." -> "Thirty-Nine Bronson Square, right? (THINKING) Watson is nearby in Lexington Gardens, clueless that I've left Baker Street."


"Uh huh. Listen to that. Carol singers." -> "Hmm. Listen to that, carol singers."

"(MOVING CLOSER) Hargrave, describe this man." -> "(MOVING CLOSER) Hargrave, describe this man."


"Oh? What was that?" -> "Oh? What was that?"


"Of course! Lou the Lisper!" -> "Of course! Lou the Lisper!"


"One of Moriarty's most trusted accomplices. Fortunately, though, I've had news of him lately through my underworld grapevine." -> "One of Moriarty's closest helpers. Luckily, I've received recent information about him from my underground sources."


"He's reputed to have some connections with a new cult that calls themselves the Disciples of the Octagonal Square. Their headquarters are just around the corner from here." -> "He's believed to have ties with a new group called the Disciples of the Octagonal Square. They're nearby, around the corner."


"Of course. And, Hargrave--?" -> "Sure. And, Hargrave--?"


"Get a message to Scotland Yard as fast as you can. Ask for Inspector Lestrade, and tell him to join me at the Temple of the Octagonal Square in Lexington Gardens as soon as possible." -> "Send a message to Scotland Yard quickly. Ask for Inspector Lestrade, tell him to meet me at the Temple of the Octagonal Square in Lexington Gardens."


"Here by the bed. This is the only room in the temple that gives any signs of having been lived in. I think our bird has been here, but I'm afraid he's flown. Wish Inspector Lestrade would get here. Strike a match, will you, Widecombe?" -> "Right here by the bed. This room shows signs of being lived in. I think our man was here, but he's left. I hope Inspector Lestrade arrives soon. Can you light a match, Widecombe?"


"Ah, just as I feared! Look on the bed." -> "Just what I thought! Look on the bed."


"Yes. Lou the Lisper has discarded his disguise and gone -- and with him, I'm afraid, your valuable presents." -> "Yes. Lou the Lisper has removed his disguise and left. He took your valuable gifts with him, I'm afraid."


"What in thunder--? Why, this is Watson's sack!" -> "What in the world--? Wait, this is Watson's bag!"


"Somewhere, somehow, he and Watson must have made an accidental change and Lou the Lisper is no doubt trying to track Watson down at this very moment. We must work fast, Widecombe -- or my friend's life, and those of Mrs. Hudson and her relatives, won't be worth a tinker's dam!" -> "Somehow, Lou the Lisper must have switched bags with Watson. He's probably trying to find Watson right now. We need to act fast, Widecombe, or my friend's life, and Mrs. Hudson's and her relatives', will be in danger!"


"Lestrade, this is no time for post mortems. We've got to reach Lou the Lisper before he finds Dr. Watson." -> "Lestrade, we can't delay. We need to find Lou the Lisper before he finds Dr. Watson."


"It wouldn't be difficult. Lou the Lisper is nearly as clever as his master, Professor Moriarty. The chances are that you were followed when you came to Baker Street tonight, Widecombe. And it's equally likely that Watson and Mrs. Hudson were followed as they left it. Moriarty seldom leaves anything to chance." -> "It won't be hard. Lou the Lisper is almost as smart as Professor Moriarty. Chances are, you were followed when you came to Baker Street tonight, Widecombe. Watson and Mrs. Hudson were probably followed when they left. Moriarty rarely leaves anything to chance


"Twenty-Eight Lexington Gardens. It's just around the corner from here." -> "Twenty-Eight Lexington Gardens. It's nearby, around the corner."


"And frighten our quarry away? No, no, no, no, Lestrade. We must use a little subtlety. Now, Lou the Lisper wishes to recover that sack of presents from Watson. How would he invade the party with the least possible trouble?" -> "And scare our target away? No, Lestrade. We need to be subtle. Lou the Lisper wants those presents from Watson. How could he enter the party without causing much trouble?"


"No. No, I think he's overplayed that role for one evening." -> "No, I think he's done enough with that role tonight."


"Oh, come now, Lestrade. What group of people can enter any house on Christmas Eve without invitation and without creating suspicion?" -> "Oh, Lestrade. Who can enter any house on Christmas Eve without an invite and without raising suspicion?"

"Form a rival choral society. How many of your men did you bring with you?" -> "Create a competing singing group. How many of your men did you bring?"


"Wearing greatcoats?" -> "Wearing long coats?"


"Good. They can hide their helmets and pretend to be singers. Come on. Let's go over there and, while we're walking, we'll rehearse our carols. We must appear reasonably convincing. (MERRILY) Sound your A, Lestrade, sound your A!" -> "Good. They can cover their helmets and act as singers. Let's go there, and on the way, we'll practice our carols. We need to look somewhat believable. (HAPPILY) Sing your A, Lestrade, sing your A!"


"Sh-sh-sh! Listen. (BEAT) Uh huh. Lou the Lisper and his men are already there." -> "Shh! Listen. (PAUSE) Uh huh. Lou the Lisper and his men are already there."


"In a moment. (TO COPPERS) Now, men -- you have your truncheons handy?" -> "In a moment. (TO POLICE) Now, men - do you have your batons ready?"


"Splendid. Now, remember -- when we're inside and I yell 'Merry Christmas' at the top of my voice, you bring out your truncheons and get Lou the Lisper and his gang out of there as quickly as possible. Don't arrest them until you get them outside again, Lestrade; I don't want to frighten the children." -> "Great. When we're inside and I shout 'Merry Christmas' loudly, bring out your batons and remove Lou the Lisper and his gang as fast as possible. Lestrade, don't arrest them until you're outside; I don't want to scare the children."


"(DISGUISED VOICE, HEARTY) How are ye, matey? You were here before us, hey? Well, what d'you say we all join in a little carol for the nippers, hey?" -> "(DISGUISED VOICE, FRIENDLY) How are you, mate? You were here first, huh? How about joining us for a carol for the kids?"


"(DISGUISED VOICE) How 'bout 'Hark! The Herald Angels Sing,' eh?" -> "(DISGUISED VOICE) How about singing 'Hark! The Herald Angels Sing,' huh?"


"(DISGUISED VOICE, LOUD) Merrrrry Christmas!" -> "(DISGUISED VOICE, LOUDLY) Merry Christmas!"


"I'll explain it to you later, old chap. (CALLS) Lestrade?!" -> "I'll tell you later, old friend. (CALLS) Lestrade?!"


"Take them to Scotland Yard and prefer charges. I'll be over in a little while and give evidence." -> "Take them to Scotland Yard and press charges. I'll come later to provide evidence."


"Well, at least we have some of his cohorts. I'll see you later, Lestrade." -> "At least we have some of his partners. I'll catch up with you later, Lestrade."


"Yes, Watson, and I'll tell you all about it as soon as I've straightened this thing out. Oh, Widecombe?" -> "Yes, Watson, and I'll explain it all once I've sorted this. Oh, Widecombe?"


"The twenty-pound notes that you used as wrapping for your gifts seem to have been scattered all over the house. Uh, do you want me to recover them, too?" -> "The twenty-pound notes you used to wrap your gifts seem to be all over the place. Should I collect them?"


"A very generous Christmas gift. Well, children -- did you enjoy the little game we staged for you?" -> "A very kind Christmas present. Well, kids - did you like the little game we set up for you?"


"(CHUCKLES) I'm glad you enjoyed it, children. And now I, er-- I want you to show me the presents you received." -> "(CHUCKLES) I'm happy you liked it, kids. Now, uh, I want to see the gifts you got."


"Oh, they were a part of the game, too! A nice little girl like you doesn't want silly earrings, Elsie. Here's a beautiful doll for you." -> "Oh, those were part of the game! You don't want earrings, Elsie. Here's a pretty doll for you."


"And what did you get, my little man?" -> "What did you get, young man?"


"Oh, cufflinks! Good gracious, who wants cufflinks when he can have a - a clockwork train! You want to exchange?" -> "Oh, cufflinks! Who wants cufflinks when you can have a - a toy train! Do you want to trade?"


"And here you are, children. Here's a nice big box of chocolates, too. You can all share them." -> "And here, kids, is a big box of chocolates for you to share."


"(CHUCKLES) Yes, old fellow. Mrs. Hudson?" -> "(CHUCKLES) Yes, old friend. Mrs. Hudson?"


"How's the turkey coming along?" -> "How's the turkey?"


"Splendid. And, while we're waiting, perhaps the children will oblige with something we haven't heard so far this evening." -> "Great. While we wait, maybe the kids can sing something new for us."


"An astonishing deduction, Watson." -> "An impressive deduction, Watson."


"Bells have accompanied nearly every historical event. They call soldiers to arms and Christians to church. They sounded the alarm during the Multan invasion in 5 ? 2. Many chapters in history were marked by the sound of bells." -> "Bells have been part of almost every historical event. They called soldiers and Christians and were alarms during the Multan invasion. Many historical moments were signaled by bells."


"Yes, Watson. It's a fascinating subject." -> "Yes, Watson. It's interesting."


"I have no idea." -> "I don't know."


"Watson, you have the sentimental imagination of the true storyteller. But we've come here for a holiday. You must give your imagination a rest, too. So, drink your tea, remove your whiskers, and we'll go downstairs and investigate those kippers." -> "Watson, you have the imaginative mind of a storyteller. But we're here on holiday. You should relax too. Finish your tea, shave, and then let's go downstairs and check the kippers."


"Yes, indeed. By the way, Mrs. Michol, we heard the funeral bell tolling earlier on. Do you know who was being buried?" -> "Yes, indeed. Mrs. Michol, we heard the funeral bell earlier. Do you know who passed away?"


"What happened, Mrs. Michol?" -> "What happened?"


"Thank you." -> "Thanks."


"Thank that I frequently had occasion to point out to you, Watson. Has the morning post arrived yet, Mrs. Michol?" -> "That's something I often remind you of, Watson. Has the morning mail come, Mrs. Michol?"


"What is there to make of it, Watson? A jealous husband murders a faithfuless wife and then commits suicide. A tragic story, but a simple one." -> "What do you make of it, Watson? A jealous husband kills his unfaithful wife and then himself. A sad but straightforward story."


"Good morning, Gillian. Any letters for me today?" -> "Good morning, Gillian. Any mail for me today?"


"Hmm, you were right, Gilly, it is newspaper clippings. And by the way, you heard about the murder of Mrs. Threadgold, I suppose?" -> "You were right, Gilly, they are newspaper clippings. Did you hear about Mrs. Threadgold's murder?"


"You're a busy man, Gillian." -> "You're quite occupied, Gillian."


"Mrs. Lakland?" -> "Mrs. Lakland?"


"Oh, very well. Ask her to come in, please, Mrs. Michol." -> "Okay. Please ask her to come in, Mrs. Michol."


"The disappearance of an only son can never be a trivial matter." -> "A son going missing is never unimportant."


"Good morning. Please sit down, Mrs. Lakland. That's it. Now what's the trouble?" -> "Good morning. Please take a seat, Mrs. Lakland. Now, what's wrong?"


"You've had no message from him since he left?" -> "You haven't heard from him since he left?"


"Have you any idea of his reason for leaving the village, Mrs. Lakland?" -> "Do you know why he left the village, Mrs. Lakland?"


"Mrs. Lakland, I'd be glad to help you, but you've given me no clues to work with. I'm afraid that I . . ." -> "Mrs. Lakland, I'd love to help, but I don't have any clues to start with. I'm afraid that I . . ."


"Mrs. Lakland, I wouldn't dream of accepting a fee. However I shall give your problem some thought. If I arrive at any conclusions, I'll get in touch with you at once." -> "Mrs. Lakland, I wouldn't take payment. But I'll think about your problem. If I find anything, I'll contact you right away."


"Good day." -> "Goodbye."


"Nor do I -- at the moment. But a young man who has grown up in a small village like this may have led a life that his mother is totally unaware of. You said that you have to work on one of your stories today, Watson." -> "I don't either - for now. A young man growing up in a small village might have a life unknown to his mother. You mentioned you need to work on a story today, Watson."


"Splendid! Then you must stay at the Inn and work on your latest masterpiece, while I scour the village to see what may be found out about the missing young man." -> "Great! You stay at the Inn and work on your new piece, and I'll explore the village to find out about the missing young man."


"Hello, Watson. I trust you had a profitable session with pen and paper?" -> "Hi, Watson. Did you have a good writing session?"


"The wedding ceremony that the worthy Gillian told us about this morning. Oh, I'm tired." -> "The wedding Gillian mentioned this morning. Oh, I'm tired."


"Among other things, that he had a secret love life unknown to his mother. And the object of his affections was none other than the maid who brought us our tea this morning." -> "He had a secret love life his mother didn't know about. And he was in love with the maid who brought us tea."


"No it's her half-day off and I was unable to find her. But I shall question her when she brings our tea tomorrow morning." -> "No, it's her day off, and I couldn't find her. I'll ask her tomorrow when she brings our tea."


"Come in, Mary." -> "Come in, Mary."


"Where's Mary this morning?" -> "Where's Mary today?"


"I hear the village bell tolling for another funeral. Does Conforth have a burial every morning? I really don't see how the population can run to it." -> "I hear the village bell for another funeral. Do they have a burial every morning in Conforth? I don't see how there are enough people for it."


"Yes, Watson, I noticed it. This peaceful village is beginning to seem strangely sinister to me. And since you have no appetite for breakfast, perhaps you'll join me in a little excursion as soon as you're dressed." -> "Yes, Watson, I saw it too. This calm village feels oddly eerie. Since you're not hungry, maybe you'll join me for a walk when you're ready."


"To see the maid, Mary. I'm anxious to talk to her before another funeral bell begins to toll." -> "I want to speak with the maid, Mary, before another funeral starts."


"Yes, and there's Mary sitting on the porch." -> "Look, there's Mary on the porch."


"Good morning, Mary. I'm sorry you're not feeling well." -> "Morning, Mary. It's a shame you're not feeling good."


"No, Watson. Let's be honest and admit we didn't come here because of our concern for Mary's health." -> "No, Watson. Let's admit we're not here for Mary's health."


"Mrs. Lakland asked me to try to find her son, Tom." -> "Mrs. Lakland asked me to find her son, Tom."


"Yes, Tom Lakland. I thought you might be able to help me, Marian." -> "Yes, Tom Lakland. I thought you might assist me, Marian."


"That sounds like your young friend from Daylis, Watson." -> "Sounds like your friend from Daylis, Watson."


"Quite. Gilly, you tolled another funeral bell today, didn't you?" -> "Yes. Gilly, you rang another funeral bell today, right?"


"Deserted you, Mary? You speak almost as if you were his wife." -> "He left you, Mary? You talk like you were his wife."


"And he never told his mother?" -> "He never told his mom?"


"When he left, did he give no clues to his destination? No hints of any kind, Mary?" -> "When he left, did he give any clues where he was going? Any hints, Mary?"


"I think I do, Mary. Watson, we're taking a short train journey as soon as possible." -> "I might know, Mary. Watson, we're taking a train trip soon."


"We're going to the town of Berry, in search of this young lady's husband." -> "We're heading to Berry to find this lady's husband."


"Because the famous Fortune Cotton Mills are in Berry. It would seem possible that when your husband joked of burying his fortune, he was talking of going to the mills there." -> "The Fortune Cotton Mills are in Berry. Maybe when he joked about burying his fortune, he meant going there."


"Hello, Watson. Permit me to introduce you to Mr. Tom Lakland. Tom, this is Dr. Watson." -> "Hi, Watson. Let me introduce you to Mr. Tom Lakland. Tom, this is Dr. Watson."


"No let's waste time on being acrimonious Watson. Let's get back to the station as fast as we can. The return of the prodigal is long overdue. We must give them every opportunity to kill the fatted calf." -> "Let's not argue, Watson. Let's hurry back to the station. We need to welcome the prodigal. We'll give them a chance to celebrate."


"And after this reunion, Tom, I suggest that you both go over and see your mother. I'm sure she'll forgive you." -> "After this reunion, Tom, I suggest you visit your mom. She'll forgive you."


"Come on Watson! Help me break in the door!" -> "Help me break the door, Watson!"


"And now, Tom, I think the time has come to reassure Mary that you did write to her." -> "Now, Tom, it's time to tell Mary that you wrote to her."


"The answer to that should be obvious my dear. Gilly the postman deliberately withheld them from you." -> "It's clear, dear. The postman Gilly kept them from you."


"I have my suspicions. Strong suspicions. But I have to get proof. Tell me Mary, the day before yesterday, Mr. Threadgold murdered his wife. Do you know how he learned of her infidelity?" -> "I suspect strongly, but I need proof. Mary, the other day, Mr. Threadgold killed his wife. Do you know how he found out she cheated?"


"Precisely! Surely the whole terrible pattern begins to take shape. Tom?" -> "Exactly! The whole horrible picture is coming together. Tom?"


"I'm going to lay a trap. To spring it I shall need your assistance." -> "I'll set a trap. I'll need your help to spring it."


"Wait here with Mary until darkness falls. Then muffle yourselves up and go to your mother's house. Wait there in hiding and let no outsiders see you until you hear from me." -> "Wait here with Mary until it gets dark. Wrap up and go to your mom's house. Hide there and don't let anyone see you until I tell you."


"Quiet, Watson. You understand, Tom?" -> "Quiet, Watson. Got it, Tom?"


"I'll tell you as we go. One thing I can promise you. Before the sun is very high tomorrow I shall free this village from one of the most subtly evil powers I've ever come in contact with." -> "I'll explain as we move. I promise to rid this village of a very sly evil force by tomorrow."


"Good morning." -> "Morning."


"Yes, madam, you can't blame her." -> "Yes, madam, you can't blame her."


"You'll soon see, old chap. Come on. Let's slip into the vestry. This way." -> "You'll see. Let's go to the vestry. Follow me."


"Up the stairs that lead to the belfry. Here they are." -> "Up the stairs to the belfry. They're here."


"Then we must handle him to the best of our ability, Watson." -> "Then we must deal with him as best we can, Watson."


"Obviously. That's why his power must be destroyed. This door apparently leads to the belfry. Keep your wits about you Watson." -> "Yes. That's why we must end his power. This door goes to the belfry. Stay alert, Watson."


"Good morning, Gilly." -> "Morning, Gilly."


"We haven't come up here to see you at work, Gilly. We know your diabolical work only too well." -> "We're not here to see you working, Gilly. We know about your evil deeds."


"You were responsible for John Letterby's suicide weren't you?" -> "Did you cause John Letterby's suicide?"


"Your reign is over Gillian. You'll never toll a bell again. The only one you'll hear will be a prison bell." -> "Gillian, your power is finished. You won't ring any more bells. You'll only hear prison bells now."


"Don't be too sure. I have enough influence to take your job away." -> "Don't be so certain. I have enough power to get you fired."


"You couldn't live without the power they give you. Could you, Gilly?" -> "You can't live without the power, can you, Gilly?"


"You are already destroyed, Gilly." -> "You're already ruined, Gilly."


"Is full of stone. You'll be the laughing stock of the village, Gilly." -> "It's full of stone. You'll be a joke in the village, Gilly."


"Come back, Gilly, come back!" -> "Come back, Gilly, come back!"


"Quite." -> "Yeah."


"No, Watson. He drew a knife as he fled. And with that rickety staircase and the narrow opening leading into the bell chamber you'd never stand a chance. He'd get you on the first ledge." -> "No, Watson. He pulled out a knife and with that shaky staircase and narrow opening, you wouldn't stand a chance. He'd catch you on the first ledge."


"There's only one way. He's in a tiny loft containing his beloved bells. We'll see how much he loves them at close quarters. I doubt if even he can stand the noise in that confined space. Where's that bell rope?" -> "There's only one way. He's in a small loft with his beloved bells. Let's see how much he likes them there. He probably can't stand the noise in that small space. Where's the bell rope?"


"Not until you come down, Gilly." -> "Not until you come down, Gilly."


"You are mad, Gilly. Mad with power. Come down here I say." -> "You're crazy, Gilly. Come down here, I say."


"I had no intention of causing that unhappy man to jump to his death, Watson. Though I can't help but feel that his poor, demented mind may find a happier oblivion this way rather than in the confines of an asylum." -> "I didn't mean for that unhappy man to jump to his death, Watson. But maybe his troubled mind finds peace this way instead of in an asylum."


"It's been a shocking case, Watson. Shocking. And once again it proves the old saying that 'violence does intrude recoil upon the violent.' And, 'the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another.'" -> "It's a shocking case, Watson. Once again, it shows 'violence comes back to those who do violence.' And, 'those who plot against others end up in their own trap.'"


"(PREOCCUPIED) Eh? Who? What? Who's that?" -> "(ABSENTLY CURT) Oh, Watson, it's you. Good evening, how do you do?"


"(ABSENTLY CURT) Oh, Watson, it's you. Good evening, how do you do?" -> "(CHUCKLES) Yes, yes, of course I do, my dear fellow. It's only that I'm profoundly engaged. My mind was elsewhere. Er, close the door, Watson. Come in. There's a confounded din from the street."


"(CHUCKLES) Yes, yes, of course I do, my dear fellow. It's only that I'm profoundly engaged. My mind was elsewhere. Er, close the door, Watson. Come in. There's a confounded din from the street." -> "(CHUCKLES) Yeah, I know, my friend. I'm just really occupied. My mind was elsewhere. Shut the door, Watson. Come in. There's a lot of noise from the street."


"(SLOWLY) And just tell me what you think of that." -> "(SLOWLY) And what do you think of that?"


"That. Hanging on the back of the chair there. I've been contemplating it for the last half hour." -> "That, hanging on the chair there. I've been thinking about it for the past thirty minutes."


"Just so." -> "Exactly."


"Excellent. Excellent, Watson. You know where everything is, of course. And meanwhile I'll tell you the tale of this hat -- and I ask you to consider it, Watson, not as a battered old billycock, but as an intellectual problem." -> "Good. Good, Watson. You know where everything is. Let me tell you about this hat - think of it as an intellectual problem."


"Well, then. You know Peterson, the commissionaire at the hotel on the corner?" -> "You know Peterson, the hotel's doorman at the corner?"


"No, his trophy." -> "No, his prize."


"Lemons? Oh, try the gasogene stand." -> "Lemons? Oh, they're at the gasogene stand."


"(LIGHTLY) Oh, well, then that hideous bamboo smoking companion that Mrs. Hudson will insist on setting down beside the sofa every afternoon." -> "(LIGHTLY) Oh, then there's that terrible bamboo smoking set Mrs. Hudson puts next to the sofa every afternoon."


"(CHUCKLES) Well now, the facts are these, Watson: Peterson -- who is a very honest fellow, as you know -- was returning about four o'clock this morning from some small seasonal jollification and walking homewards down the Tottenham Court Road." -> "(CHUCKLES) Well, here's the thing, Watson: Peterson - an honest guy - was coming back around four this morning from a little party and walking home along Tottenham Court Road."


"Certainly, Watson. Heh! Of course." -> "Sure, Watson. Heh! Yeah."


"In front of him, there in the gaslight, Peterson suddenly saw a tallish man with a stick, walking with a slight stagger and carrying a white goose over his shoulder." -> "Peterson saw a tall man with a stick walking unsteadily in the gaslight. He had a white goose over his shoulder."


"As he reached the corner of Warren Street, this man was suddenly set upon by a crowd of roughs. One of them knocked his hat off and as he raised his stick to defend himself, he accidentally swung it against a shop window and smashed the glass." -> "When he got to Warren Street, a group of rough people attacked him. One of them knocked off his hat, and when he tried to defend himself, he accidentally hit a shop window with his stick, breaking it."


"Well, Peterson, who was still wearing his commissionaire's uniform, rushed to the man's assistance. But the fellow, shocked at breaking a window and seeing a man in uniform running up to him, dropped his goose and took to his heels." -> "Peterson, in his uniform, hurried to help the man. But the man got scared seeing someone in uniform after breaking the window, dropped his goose, and ran away."


"The roughs did the same, leaving Peterson master of the field of battle. He brought both bird and hat to me. There was a card on the bird's leg with 'For Mrs. Henry Baker' written on it and the initials 'H. B.' are written on the label inside the hat." -> "Peterson was left in charge after the rough people ran away. He brought the bird and hat to me. The bird had a card saying 'For Mrs. Henry Baker' and the hat had 'H. B.' written inside."


"But of course there are some thousands of people named Baker in this great city of ours, so it has been my little occupation for this last hour or so to try and deduce the exact identity of this one." -> "There are many people named Baker in this city, so I've been trying to figure out which one this refers to for the last hour or so."


"Yes, Watson. (THOUGHTFUL) The owner of this hat, Watson-- (SOUND: DRINK POURED) --highly intellectual, fairly well-to-do, but in the space of the last three years seems to have fallen on evil days. He used to have foresight, but he has less now than formerly. I suspect he's taken to drink, which would also perhaps account for the fact that his wife no longer loves him." -> "Yes, Watson. (THOUGHTFUL) The person who owns this hat - highly smart, quite well-off, but in the last three years, their life took a turn for the worse. They used to be more thoughtful but less so now. I think they might be drinking, which might explain why their wife doesn't love them anymore."


"(CONTINUES) Middle-aged, goes out little, has grizzled hair -- which he anoints with lime-cream -- and has been to the barber's lately. It is also extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house." -> "(CONTINUES) Middle-aged, doesn't go out much, has grey hair - they use lime-cream on it and have been to the barber recently. It's very unlikely they have gas in their house."


"Not at all." -> "Nope."


"Ah?" -> "Oh?"


"(SIMPLY) The hat hasn't been brushed for weeks, my dear fellow." -> "(SIMPLY) The hat hasn't been cleaned in weeks, my dear friend."


"Well, when I see you, Watson, with such an accumulation of dust on your respectable headgear, I shall expect you to be returning to your old quarters here within the next day or two." -> "When I see your hat covered in so much dust, Watson, I'll expect you back here in a day or two."


"Not at all. One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance, but when I see no less than five, I think there can be little doubt that the owner must be brought in frequent contact with burning tallow. Yes, he probably walks upstairs at night with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other. Anyhow, he never got tallow stains from a gasjet. Satisfied?" -> "Nope. A couple of tallow stains might happen, but seeing five makes it clear the owner often deals with burning tallow. Maybe they walk upstairs at night with a candle. They didn't get these stains from a gas light. Understand?"


"Elementary, my dear Watson." -> "Simple, my dear Watson."


"That goose, my dear fellow--" -> "That goose, my dear friend--"


"Hello, hello, what's this? Who is it? (CALLS) Yes? Come in!" -> "What's this? Who's there? (CALLS) Yes? Come in!"


"My dear Peterson!" -> "Peterson!"


"(LIGHTLY) Well, has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window? You're as white as a sheet." -> "(LIGHTLY) Did it suddenly come back to life and fly out through the kitchen window? You look scared."


"(BEAT, ASTONISHED) Watson! Look." -> "(PAUSE, SURPRISED) Watson! Look."


"It's more than a precious stone, Watson. It's the precious stone. The blue carbuncle." -> "It's not just any gem, Watson. It's the blue carbuncle, a precious stone."


"Precisely. Missing for five days and with a descriptive advertisement every morning in The Times about it. And a reward of a thousand pounds for its recovery." -> "Exactly. It's been missing for five days, and there's an ad in The Times describing it every morning. They're offering a reward of a thousand pounds to find it."


"That's it, and they've arrested some plumber fellow who's supposed to have taken it from the countess's jewel case." -> "That's what happened. They've arrested a plumber who supposedly took it from the countess's jewelry box."


"What else, Watson?" -> "What more, Watson?"


"Hmm." -> "Hmm."


"Hmm. Well, then the only problem remaining to be solved is the sequence of events leading from an empty jewel-case in a hotel room at one end, to the crop of a goose in the Tottenham Court Road at the other. Er, just give me a pencil and that slip of paper, will you, Peterson?" -> "Hmm. So the only thing left to solve is how a empty jewelry case in a hotel room connects to a goose in Tottenham Court Road. Hand me a pencil and paper, will you, Peterson?"


"Find the owner of this hat. (AS HE WRITES) "H. B., Henry Baker." (TO WATSON) Yes, he began as a joke and now he's become a mystery. We'll try the simplest method first -- an advertisement. How's this, Watson? Read it." -> "Find the owner of this hat. (AS HE WRITES) "H. B., Henry Baker." (TO WATSON) It started as a joke, but now it's a mystery. Let's start simple - an ad. What do you think, Watson? Read it."


"Clear and concise, I think. Yes, if you've quite recovered from your astonishment, Peterson--" -> "I believe it's clear and brief. Yes, if you're no longer surprised, Peterson--"


"(AMUSED) Just run down to the advertisement office and have this put in all the evening papers, will you?" -> "(AMUSED) Go to the ad office and put this in all the papers tonight, okay?"


"All of them. Oh, and by the way, Peterson--?" -> "In every one. Oh, and Peterson--?"


"On your way back, just see if you can buy another goose." -> "When you return, try to buy another goose."


"Yes, as near as possible the same size as that one that your family is about to devour." -> "Yes, try to get one similar in size to the one your family is eating."


"Yes, here in my strong-box. And I'll just drop a note to the Countess to say we found it. Hurry up, Peterson." -> "Yes, in my safe. I'll send a note to the Countess saying we found it. Quick, Peterson."


"(CHUCKLES)" -> "(CHUCKLES)"


"Ah, Mr. Henry Baker, if I am not mistaken. Do come in, Mr. Baker." -> "Ah, Mr. Henry Baker, I think. Please, come in."


"Sit down, won't you? Pray, sit down." -> "Take a seat, please. Sit down."


"Mayn't I help you to a whiskey and soda, Mr. Baker?" -> "Would you like a whiskey and soda, Mr. Baker?"


"(WITH A CHUCKLE) Oh, of course." -> "(WITH A CHUCKLE) Of course."


"(PLEASED) You see, Watson?" -> "(PLEASED) You see, Watson?"


"Now, Mr. Baker, you've come, haven't you, in answer to my advertisement? Er, is this your hat?" -> "Mr. Baker, you're here about the ad, right? Is this your hat?"


"Then pray allow me to return it to you with my compliments. The bird, I am afraid, we've been compelled to eat." -> "Let me give it back to you as a gift. Sadly, we had to eat the bird."


"It was quite a necessity, I'm afraid, since in these modern days we seem to have lost the art of refrigeration in which our Elizabethan ancestors were so adept. However, there's this other bird here on the sideboard to which you're extremely welcome as a replacement." -> "We had to because we don't have good refrigeration like in the past. But we have another bird here that you can have instead."


"Not at all. (CAREFULLY) Of course, er, we still have the feathers and the crop of your own bird, if you'd like to take them, too." -> "No problem. (CAREFULLY) If you want, we have the feathers and crop of your bird here."


"(CHUCKLES)" -> "(CHUCKLES)"


"Most certainly. Would it trouble you, Mr. Baker, to tell me where you got that uncommonly fine bird of yours?" -> "Of course. Can you tell me where you got that fine bird?"


"The Alpha Inn, Watson." -> "At the Alpha Inn, Watson."


"All's well that ends well, Mr. Baker. We were fortunate enough to find it, so-- Here's your hat." -> "Everything's fine now, Mr. Baker. We found it, so here's your hat."


"And here is your new bird. Oh, I've put the old ticket onto it -- the one that was tied to the other goose's leg -- marked 'To Mrs. Henry Baker.'" -> "Here's your new bird. I put the old tag on it - the one from the other goose - saying 'To Mrs. Henry Baker.'"


"Well, not at all. A peace offering, Mr. Baker?" -> "No, it's a gift, Mr. Baker?"


"Ah, quite." -> "Yes, indeed."


"Good night, Mr. Baker." -> "Good night, Mr. Baker."


"Well, well, well. So much for Mr. Henry Baker, Watson." -> "That's Mr. Henry Baker for you, Watson."


"Yes, evident. I suggest, Watson, that we turn that proposed dinner of ours into a late supper. I'll tell Mrs. Hudson -- she'll forgive us -- and in the meanwhile let's follow up the clew of the Alpha Inn." -> "Yes, it's clear. I think we should have a late dinner instead. I'll tell Mrs. Hudson. Let's check the Alpha Inn in the meantime."


"Yes, I'm afraid we shall have to battle our way out through those infernal waifs who are making night so hideous on our humble doorstep. Come, Watson -- we've work to do this Christmas Eve." -> "Yes, we'll have to get past those noisy kids at our door. Come on, Watson, we have work to do this Christmas Eve."


"Breckinridge, Watson. Here, there it is -- you see? The largest stall of the lot. There's the name written up over it." -> "It's Breckinridge, Watson. Look, there it is - the biggest stall. See the name over it?"


"What's that you say? Horsy? (PLEASED) Good for you, Watson. That fact might come in useful. (BEAT, WINNINGLY) Ah, good evening, Mr. Breckinridge. Mm, it's a cold night." -> "What? Horsy? (PLEASED) Good job, Watson. That might be helpful. (BEAT, WINNINGLY) Hello, Mr. Breckinridge. It's cold tonight."


"Sold out of geese, I see." -> "You're out of geese, I see."


"Ah, that's no good, I'm afraid. We want one tonight." -> "That's not good. We need one tonight."


"Yes, you supplied him with some incomparable birds, he told us. Where did you get them from, by the way?" -> "He said you sold him amazing birds. Where did they come from?"


"Why, nothing, only that I wanted to know who sold you those geese." -> "I just wanted to know who sold you those geese, nothing else."


"Another one? What do you mean?" -> "Another what? What do you mean?"


"(LIGHTLY) Well, I can assure you that we've nothing to do with any other people who've been making inquiries, Mr. Breckinridge. In fact, all I'm concerned with-- (CHUCKLE) --is a little bet I've made." -> "(LIGHTLY) We're not involved with others asking questions. I'm just here for a bet I made."


"Just so. I'm always ready to back my opinion and I bet a fiver with my friend the doctor here that the bird we et from the Alpha Inn was country bred." -> "Yes, I always back my opinion. I bet my friend here five pounds that the bird from the Alpha Inn was bred in the country."


"No-no-no, it was nothing of the kind." -> "No, it wasn't like that."


"(INTERRUPTS) I tell you, it's country bred." -> "(INTERRUPTS) It's country bred, I'm telling you."


"With pleasure. A sovereign. Every penny of it." -> "Sure. A pound. All of it."


"Well, what's this?" -> "What's this?"


"Can you see it, Watson, in this light?" -> "Can you see it, Watson, in this light?"


"(CHUCKLES RUEFULLY) Well, I must say, I could have sworn it was country bred. All right, you win, Mr. Breckinridge." -> "(CHUCKLES RUEFULLY) Well, I thought it was country bred. Okay, you win, Mr. Breckinridge."


"(MOVING OFF, CHEERFUL) Good evening, Mr. Breckinridge. (BEAT, ON MIKE, THOUGHTFUL) Well, Watson, let's stand here by the gas lamp for a moment. I want to think." -> "(MOVING OFF, CHEERFUL) Good evening, Mr. Breckinridge. (BEAT, ON MIKE, THOUGHTFUL) Well, Watson, let's stand here by the gas lamp for a moment. I want to think."


"Hello, what's going on?" -> "Hey, what's happening?"


"(PLEASED) Oh, yes. So there is. Let's see what's the matter." -> "(PLEASED) Oh, yes. There is. Let's see."


"(QUIETLY DELIGHTED) The little fellow's coming this way, Watson. It looks as if we've saved our trip to Brixton." -> "(QUIETLY DELIGHTED) That guy's coming here, Watson. Seems like we won't need to go to Brixton after all."


"Stand by if he gets nasty. He looks a bit of a shrimp, though; not much trouble. (CALLS, TO RYDER) Here, my man! Not so fast. I'd just like a word with you." -> "Be ready in case he gets aggressive. He seems small, won't be much trouble. (CALLS, TO RYDER) Hey, you! Hold on. I want to talk."


"I couldn't help overhearing your little disagreement with the good salesman over there, and I think I might be able to assist you." -> "I overheard your argument with the salesman. I might be able to help."


"My name is Sherlock Holmes, and it's my business to know what other people don't know." -> "I'm Sherlock Holmes. I know things others don't."


"On the contrary. You're trying to trace some geese, which were sold by a Mrs. Oakshott, to that man there, who sold them to the landlord of the Alpha Inn, who got rid of them through his goose club, of which Mr. Henry Baker is a member." -> "Actually, you're trying to find geese sold by Mrs. Oakshott, then sold to that man, who sold them to the Alpha Inn's landlord. Henry Baker is part of the club."


"Watson, be good enough to signal for a four-wheeler, will you?" -> "Watson, please call for a four-wheeler, okay?"


"I think, my friend, we'd better discuss this whole matter in some cozy place rather than in the crowded street. We'll go to my room, shall we? Oh, what's your name, may I ask?" -> "Let's talk about this somewhere quiet, not on the street. We'll go to my room. By the way, what's your name?"


"No-no-no, the real name. It's always so awkward doing business with an alias." -> "I mean your real name. It's hard to do business with an alias."


"Ah! Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan, I believe." -> "Ah! You work at the Hotel Cosmopolitan, right?"


"Quite so. You have the cab, Watson?" -> "Exactly. Do you have the cab, Watson?"


"You, er-- You want to know what became of those geese, Mr. Ryder -- or rather of that goose, for I fancy it was only one that you were interested in: a white one with a black bar across its tail." -> "You want to know about those geese, Mr. Ryder. Or more like that one goose you were interested in, a white one with a black bar on its tail."


"(LAUGHS BRIEFLY) And a most remarkable bird, if I may say so, Mr. Ryder. Watson, hand me over my strong-box, if you please." -> "(LAUGHS BRIEFLY) It was quite an unusual bird, Mr. Ryder. Watson, pass me my strong-box, please."


"Ah, that bird laid an egg after it was dead, Mr. Ryder." -> "That bird laid an egg after it died, Mr. Ryder."


"The bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen. I have it here." -> "It's the loveliest, brightest little blue egg ever seen. I've got it here."


"The game's up, Ryder." -> "You're caught, Ryder."


"Hang on to him, Watson!" -> "Grab him, Watson!"


"Poor devil, hey? Heavens, what a worm the fellow is. He's not got blood enough to go in for felony." -> "Poor guy, huh? My, he's quite the coward. He's not tough enough for crime."


"You know perfectly well what you've done, Ryder. It only needs one or two more links, Watson, to make the case complete. Now then, Ryder, who told you of the Countess of Morcar's jewel, the blue carbuncle?" -> "You know exactly what you did, Ryder. We just need a couple more pieces of evidence, Watson, to make the case solid. Now, Ryder, who told you about the Countess of Morcar's jewel, the blue carbuncle?"


"Exactly. And so you invented some excuse to send that unfortunate young Horner into the countess's hotel room -- and after he was gone, you rifled the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and put the blame onto him." -> "Right. So, you made up a reason to send Horner into the countess's hotel room. Then, after he left, you stole from the jewel-case, made noise, and framed him."


"(JUST AS HE THOUGHT) Ah." -> "(AS HE SUSPECTED) Ah."


"Get up off the floor, man! It's no good kneeling to me. You didn't show much mercy to Horner, did you?" -> "Get up! Kneeling won't help. You weren't merciful to Horner, were you?"


"Get up. Get up! Watson, help him onto his feet, for heaven's sake." -> "Get up. Get up! Watson, help him stand, please."


"(INTERRUPTS) Your sister?" -> "(INTERRUPTS) Your sister?"


"Aha." -> "I see."


"Ah, you forced the stone down the bird's throat." -> "Oh, you made the bird swallow the stone."


"(MOVING TO THE DOOR, SLOW AND THOUGHTFUL) I'm not quite sure, but I think, all things considered, it might be best to--" -> "(MOVING TO THE DOOR, SLOW AND THOUGHTFUL) I'm not entirely sure, but I think it might be best to--"


"(SHARPLY) --get out, Ryder!" -> "(SHARPLY) --get out, Ryder!"


"I mean get out, man!" -> "I mean get out, man!"


"I don't want to hear any more from you; get out." -> "I don't want to hear more from you; get out."


"Get out!" -> "Get out!"


"(QUIETLY CONTEMPLATIVE) Well, well! A most singular and whimsical business, my dear Watson." -> "(QUIETLY CONTEMPLATIVE) Well, well! A very strange and odd situation, my dear Watson."


"Well, when all is said and done, Watson, I'm really not retained by the police to supplement their deficiencies. As soon as I send the stone back, the case against Horner will collapse at once. There'll be no witness." -> "After all, Watson, I'm not working for the police to cover their mistakes. Once I return the stone, Horner's case will fall apart. There won't be a witness."


"(LIGHTLY) Well, it's just possible that I'm also saving a soul. I don't believe he'll go wrong again. (WITH A CHUCKLE) He's too scared. Besides, Watson--" -> "(LIGHTLY) Maybe I'm saving a soul too. I don't think he'll do wrong again. (WITH A CHUCKLE) He's too scared. Also, Watson--"


"Well, this is the season of forgiveness, man. (BEAT) Listen. Twelve o'clock! It's Christmas Day. (BEAT) Oh, pass me some of that delicious punch of yours, won't you? And tell me you forgive me, too." -> "It's the time for forgiveness, buddy. (PAUSE) Listen. It's twelve o'clock! It's Christmas Day. (PAUSE) Give me some of that tasty punch, please? And tell me you forgive me too."


"For being so surly yesterday morning when you offered me the compliments of the season. I return them now with all my heart. And here's your health, old friend, with my glass upraised. A merry Christmas, my dear Watson." -> "I apologize for being grumpy yesterday morning when you wished me a happy season. I wish you the same now with all my heart. Here's to you, my old friend. A happy Christmas, dear Watson."


"God save her gracious Majesty." -> "God save the Queen."


"I see you have some newspapers there, Watson. Let's see what they have to say about the matter." -> "I see you have some newspapers there, Watson. Let's see what they say about this."


"He put on a mackintosh, for it was raining heavily, and left the house." -> "He wore a raincoat because it was pouring, then he went out."


"(TO WATSON) Hm! Quite a wealth of detail, my dear Watson. And here I have the notes of Mrs. Straker's statement." -> "(TO WATSON) Hmm! Lots of information here, Watson. I've got Mrs. Straker's statement notes."


"(READS) 'After her husband had gone out she went back to sleep again and didn't wake until seven o'clock in the morning. Finding him still absent, she called the maid and they set off together for the stables. They found the door wide open. Inside, huddled on a chair, was Hunter in a state of complete stupor. The lads in the loft overhead had heard nothing all night, but the favorite's stall was empty and there was no sign of the trainer.'" -> "(READS) 'After her husband left, she went back to sleep and only woke at seven in the morning. When she didn't find him, she got the maid and went to the stables. They found the door open and Hunter inside, out of it. The stable boys upstairs didn't hear anything, but the horse was missing and so was the trainer.'"


"Undoubtedly. (READS) 'Mrs. Straker and the maid left him and ran up to the moor to see whether Straker had merely taken the horse out for exercise. And so the murder was discovered.' (TO WATSON) Suppose you read me the rest of Mrs. Straker's statement." -> "Certainly. (READS) 'Mrs. Straker and the maid went up to the moor to check if Straker took the horse out. That's when they found the murder.' (TO WATSON) Why don't you read the rest of Mrs. Straker's statement?"


"Well, Watson, that has passed our little journey quite agreeably. And here we are at Tavistock." -> "Watson, our journey's been quite pleasant. Now we're in Tavistock."


"I trust that I may be able to assist you, sir. Has there been any fresh development?" -> "I hope I can help you, sir. Any new updates?"


"Excellent, my dear Watson. It's more than possible; it's probable. In which case one of the main points in favor of the accused disappears." -> "Great, Watson. It's not just possible, it's likely. If that's the case, a significant argument for the accused disappears."


"(TO INSPECTOR) A clever counsel would tear your case to rags. Why should Simpson take the horse out of the stable? If he wished to injure it, he could do it there. Has a duplicate key to the stable door been found in his possession? What chemist sold him the powdered opium? Above all, where could he -- he, a stranger to the district -- hide a horse? And such a horse as this! (BEAT) Tell me, what is his own explanation as to the note which he wished the maid to give to the stable boy?" -> "(TO INSPECTOR) A smart lawyer would demolish your case. Why would Simpson take the horse out? He could harm it in the stable. Did he have a spare key to the stable door? Which chemist sold him opium? Also, where could a stranger hide such a horse here? What did Simpson say about the note he asked the maid to give the stable boy?"


"What does he say about the cravat?" -> "What did he say about the necktie?"


"Mmm, it's certainly possible." -> "Hmm, it could be."


"There's another training stable quite close, I believe." -> "I think there's another horse training place nearby."


"And nothing to connect Fitzroy Simpson with their interests?" -> "Fitzroy Simpson isn't linked to their activities?"


"No, I think I prefer to stay here a little while and go into one or two questions of detail. Straker was brought back here, I suppose." -> "No, I'd rather stay here and discuss a few details. Straker was brought back here, right?"


"He's been in your service some years, Colonel?" -> "He's worked for you for a while, Colonel?"


"I presume that you made an inventory of what he had in his pockets at the time of his death, Inspector?" -> "Did you list what he had in his pockets when he died, Inspector?"


"Aha." -> "I see."


"Yea. A very singular knife, Watson. Surely in your line." -> "Yeah. Quite an unusual knife, Watson. It's in your expertise."


"A strange thing for a man to carry with him on a rough expedition. Why, it won't even shut up to go into his pocket." -> "Odd for someone on a tough journey. It won't even fold to fit in a pocket."


"And the papers?" -> "What about the papers?"


"May I see that bill, please?" -> "Can I see that bill?"


"William Derbyshire?" -> "William Derbyshire?"


"Had he been staying here then? Did Mrs. Straker know him?" -> "Was he staying here? Did Mrs. Straker know him?"


"How do you do, Mrs. Straker? Surely we've met before. At a garden party in Plymouth recently." -> "Hello, Mrs. Straker. I think we met at a garden party in Plymouth, right?"


"Dear me, I could have sworn it. You wore a costume of dove-colored silk with ostrich feather trimmings." -> "Oh, my mistake. You wore a dove-colored silk outfit with ostrich feathers, didn't you?"


"Oh. Well, that settles it then." -> "Oh, that clears things up."


"Of course." -> "Sure."


"(CHUCKLES) Oh, do you? As a matter of fact, I was just remembering a really excellent curry we once et together in Soho." -> "(CHUCKLES) Oh, really? I was just thinking about this great curry we had in Soho."


"There was no wind that night, I understand." -> "I heard there was no wind that night."


"Well, in that case the coat was not blown against the furze-bushes. It must have been placed there." -> "If that's true, the coat wasn't blown to the bushes; someone put it there."


"Very interesting." -> "That's fascinating."


"(IMPRESSED) My dear Inspector, you surpass yourself." -> "(IMPRESSED) Inspector, you've outdone yourself."


"Hullo! What's this? A spent match, eh? Excellent." -> "Hey, what's this? A used match? Great."


"It was invisible; buried in the mud. I only found it because I was looking for it." -> "It was hidden in the mud. I found it while searching."


"I thought it not unlikely. You'll have searched the ferns around the rim of the hollow for any more tracks, of course." -> "I figured it was possible. You must have checked the ferns for more tracks around the hollow."


"Good. Then I'll take a little walk over the moors before it grows dark, and I think I'll put this horseshoe in my pocket - just for luck." -> "Alright. I'll stroll over the moors before it gets dark. I'll keep this horseshoe in my pocket for luck."


"Certainly not, Colonel! I should let the name stand." -> "No way, Colonel! I'll leave the name as is."


"We may leave the question of who killed John Straker for the moment and confine ourselves to finding out what has become of the horse." -> "For now, let's put aside who killed John Straker and focus on finding the horse."


"Oh, dear, no. The horse is a gregarious animal. If left to himself, his instincts would have been either to return to King's Pyland or go on over to Capleton yonder. Why should he run wild upon the moor? As he's not at King's Pyland, he must be over there - at Capleton! Come along." -> "No, not at all. Horses are social creatures. Left alone, he'd either return to King's Pyland or head to Capleton. Why would he run wild on the moor? If he's not at King's Pyland, he must be at Capleton! Let's go."


"I only wanted to ask you a question. Would I be too early to see your master, Mr. Silas Brown, if I were to call here at five o'clock tomorrow morning?" -> "I just wanted to ask a question. Would it be too early to see Mr. Silas Brown at five o'clock tomorrow morning?"


"Ten minutes talk with you, my good sir." -> "Could we talk for ten minutes, sir?"


"One word in your ear, my friend. In your own interest. (WHISPERS INDECIPHERABLY FOR A FEW SECONDS)" -> "A quick word, my friend, for your benefit. (WHISPERS INAUDIBLY FOR A FEW SECONDS)"


"Very good. Shall we argue about it here in public or talk it over in your parlor? Or do I go to the police?" -> "Alright. Should we discuss this here or in private? Or should I involve the police?"


"There must be no mistake." -> "No mistakes, alright?"


"(CHUCKLES) No, no, don't. I'll write to you about that. No tricks now!" -> "(CHUCKLES) No, don't do that. I'll send you a letter. No tricks!"


"Yes, I think I can. Well, you shall hear from me tomorrow. Good day to you." -> "Yes, I believe so. You'll get a message from me tomorrow. Goodbye."


"You see, Watson? A more perfect compound of the bully, coward, and sneak than Master Silas Brown I have seldom met with." -> "You see, Watson? I rarely come across someone who's a bully, coward, and sneak all in one, like Master Silas Brown."
(LAUGHS) Just wash his face and leg with spirits of wine, and he'll be the same old Silver Blaze. -> (LAUGHS) Simply clean his face and leg with spirits of wine, and he'll be the familiar Silver Blaze.


Yes, I found him with a fakir and raced him as he was sent over. -> Yep, I found him with a horse-trader and raced him without any changes.


(QUIETLY) I have done so. -> (QUIETLY) Yes, I did.


He's in our company at the present moment. -> He's currently with us.


I am not referring to you, Colonel. The real murderer is standing immediately before you. -> I'm not talking about you, Colonel. The actual killer is right here.


Yes, the horse. Silver Blaze himself. (BEAT) It may lessen the guilt somewhat if I say that the killing was done entirely in self-defense and that John Straker was a man who was quite unworthy of your confidence. -> Yes, the horse. Silver Blaze himself. (PAUSE) To some extent, it might reduce the blame if I explain that the horse acted in self-defense. John Straker wasn't someone deserving of your trust.


There goes the bell, and as I stand to win a little on the next race, I shall defer a lengthier explanation till a more fitting time. -> The bell's rung, and I have a bet on the next race, so I'll explain more later.


I must confess that I even suspected Fitzroy Simpson myself for a time. It was only when I reached the trainer's house that the immense significance of the curried mutton occurred to me. -> I have to admit, I suspected Fitzroy Simpson for a while. It wasn't until I got to the trainer's house that I understood the importance of the curried mutton.


Exactly. Powdered opium has a disagreeable and perceptible flavor. Only something more strongly flavored -- like a curry -- could have disguised the taste. Now, Fitzroy Simpson could never have known that the maid would be serving the stable lad with a curry that night. The only people who could have known that were people in the house. So who could have taken advantage of the fact? Then there was the silence of the dog when the horse was taken from the stable. It failed to bark because it knew who the intruder was. I was already quite convinced that the intruder must have been John Straker himself. -> Precisely. Powdered opium tastes bad and noticeable. Only a stronger flavor like curry could cover it up. Fitzroy Simpson couldn't have known about the curry. The only ones who knew were people in the house. Then, the dog's silence when the horse was taken hinted at the intruder's identity. I was already sure it was John Straker.


The answer to that was in John Straker's pocket. -> The answer to that was in John Straker's pocket.


Precisely. Addressed to William Derbyshire. That set me thinking. Perhaps John Straker was leading a double life. After all, his wife confirmed that the expensive costume wasn't for her, and by recognizing the photo that I showed her, Madame Lesurier, the dressmaker, later confirmed that John Straker had indeed bought it there -- to give to a woman of more expensive tastes than his wife. -> Exactly. It was addressed to William Derbyshire. That got me thinking. Maybe John Straker had a double life. His wife confirmed the expensive outfit wasn't for her. Madame Lesurier, the dressmaker, recognized the photo and confirmed that John Straker bought it for another woman with expensive taste.


The knife gave me the final clue. It was a surgical knife -- such as could be used to lame a horse without leaving any visible evidence of foul play. By laming Silver Blaze and betting on Desborough, John Straker would have been able to retrieve his fortune. -> The knife was the key. It was a surgical knife that could lame a horse without evidence. By injuring Silver Blaze and betting on Desborough, Straker aimed to win back his fortune.


He led the horse out onto the moor so that when he cut its tendon its plunging wouldn't waken the grooms overhead. In order that he could see what he was going to do, he needed a candle. So that the candle should not be seen, he led the horse to the hollow. In lighting the candle, he dropped that spent match in the mud. Unfortunately for him, the light must have scared the horse -- unless it was instinct. Whichever it was, the horse lashed out and its steel shoe caught Straker full in the forehead. He'd already taken off his mackintosh to be freer -- and, as he fell, gashed his thigh on his own knife. -> He took the horse to the moor to cut its tendon quietly without alerting the grooms upstairs. He needed a candle to see, so he went to the hollow. While lighting the candle, he dropped the match in the mud. The light spooked the horse, and it kicked, hitting Straker in the forehead. He had taken off his coat earlier for comfort. As he fell, he cut his thigh on his own knife.


Simpson said that he lost it; no doubt he did. Straker must have found it and picked it up, perhaps with the idea of using it to secure the horse's leg. Well, that disposes of everything. Quite simple. Perhaps we could while away the rest of this journey, my dear Watson, with a game of chess. -> Simpson mentioned losing it, and Straker likely found it. He might have intended to use it to secure the horse's leg. That explains everything. Quite simple. Maybe we could play chess for the rest of the journey, Watson.


Care for a cigar, Watson? -> Want a cigar, Watson?
Flying Scotsman train is doing really well, going at fifty-three-and-a-half miles an hour. -> The Flying Scotsman is living up to its name, traveling splendidly at fifty-three-and-a-half miles per hour.


I haven't measured it myself, but the telegraph posts are sixty yards apart on this line. Using a watch, it's simple to calculate our speed. Watson, my dear friend, we have several hours ahead of us. Tell me more about Sir Walter Dunbar. I sense he's facing some trouble, and you haven't wanted to discuss it. -> I haven't personally measured it, but the telegraph posts along this line are sixty yards apart. With a watch, it's easy to calculate our speed. Watson, my dear friend, we have several hours ahead of us. Tell me more about Sir Walter Dunbar.

Do I, my dear Watson? I must say, I am absolutely fascinated by listening to three people accusing each other of murder -- and each of them producing perfectly sound motives. It's a remarkable example of the dangers of reasoning from motive alone. We should profit by experience, Watson. -> I suppose this game of charades is getting a little out of hand, Miss Small. Let's conclude it. (CALLS) You'd better come out now!
