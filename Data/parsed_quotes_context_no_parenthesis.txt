I say, Holmes -- I wish you'd stop that caterwauling.
Hmpf!
===
Well -- ah - -well you could straighten up this room. It looks more like a pig sty every day.
Oh, very well -
===
What are you doing Holmes - pulling that large tin box in here?
House cleaning -- the key? Oh yes...
===
What have you got in there?
Cases - records of some of my earlier cases -- done -- ah -- prematurely. -- before I had such a competent biographer. I think if you knew what I had in this box, you'd ask me to pull some out, instead of putting others in.
===
It's no use, Holmes - you can't get 'round me like that. You might just as well begin putting your stuff away.
Hmm -- here's the record of the Tarleton murders...the case of Varnberry --
===
Hmph --
The adventure of the Russian woman - and the singular affair of the aluminum crutch.
===
Aluminum crutch?
Yes -- a most amazing story -- it was one April day -- the rain was coming down in torrents...
===
I'm not interested.
Heigh ho -- well, I suppose I'd best get to work. Ah -- here -- now here really is something a little recherche. 
===
Bah - it's nothing but a wooden box with a sliding lid.
But look inside - look inside. 
===
Hmmm - a crumpled piece of paper - with some doggerel written on it - an old fashioned brass key - a peg of wood with a ball of string attached, and three rusty old discs of metal -- not very impressive.
Well -- what do you make of it?
===
It's a strange collection.
And there is a stranger story connected with it.
===
Hmph -- I suspected these relics had a history.
They are history, my dear Watson - they are history.
===
What was it about?
These are all I have left to remind me of the Musgrave Ritual - fascinating 
===
Er- - what was the Musgrave Ritual?
You want to interrupt my labors with a silly story -- dear, dear -- and leave all this litter as it is reprehensible, my dear Watson - thoroughly reprehensible.
===
Oh -- get on with the story.
Very well -- it was one of my first cases -- when I was making a most precarious living out of my sleuthing. It had to do with Reginald Musgrave -- a scion of one of the oldest families in the Kingdom. Well, I hadn't seen Reginald Musgrave for several years -- until one morning I received a note from him. Here it is.
===
"My dear Sherlock: I hear that you are turning to practical ends these powers with which you used to analyze us. Could you spare time to visit us at Hurlstone? I can promise you a problem which will tax even your nimble wits. Hopefully yours, Reggie Musgrave."
You can imagine my eagerness. In my innermost heart, I believed that I could succeed where others had failed. 
===
Well, Holmes -- delighted to see you, my dear fellow. It's awfully good of you to come. You've gotten taller and thinner than ever.
You're much the same I should say, Musgrave. 
===
Yes sir --
Your -- ah - butler is new at his job, isn't he? 
===
Yes -- but how did you know?
His uniform is rather a bad fit -- and his legs are- better suited to the stable yard than the drawing room. 
===
Well, as a matter of fact -- he's just been promoted to his post. He used to be the head coachman. It's about Brunton -- our old butler -- that I wanted to see you. 
What about him?
===
He's disappeared.
Brunton's disappeared, eh? Seems to me I've heard you mention his name before.
===
I dare say you have. He's been in service here for nearly twenty years -- although he's barely forty, now. 
Rather unusual.
===
Yes. He was a young school teacher out of a place when he was first taken up by my father. He was a man of great ability -- handsome, spoke several languages, and played every musical instrument. A paragon -- Brunton had only one fault.
Yes?
===
He was a bit of a Don Juan -- a few months ago, we were in hope that he was about to settle down for he became engaged to Rachel Howells, our second maid.
Well?
===
Well, he has since thrown her over, and taken up with the daughter of the head gamekeeper.
And what was this girl - ah - Rachel like? 
===
Rachel is a very good girl - but of an excitable Welsh temperament - she had a touch of brain fever -- subsequent to the smashup of her romance. I'm really rather worried about the girl.
Yes, but look here, Musgrave -- you haven't brought me all the way from London to discuss a servant girl's love affairs?
===
That was our first drama at Hurlstone, and quite a tempest in a teapot it was, you know what country houses are like. But a second one came to drive it from our minds -- and it was prefaced by the disgrace and dismissal of the butler, Brunton.
Dismissal?
===
BRIDGE TO NEXT SCENE
And after that little set-to -- you were too annoyed to sleep -- eh, Musgrave?
===
Well, as a matter of fact -- I did spend the rest of the night thinking of things I should have said to the fellow -- however, by morning I had calmed down somewhat.
And Brunton?
===
For two days afterwards, Brunton was most assiduous in his attention to his duties. On the third day, he was gone. 
Gone? Gone where?
===
Yes -- she's been very ill ever since his disappearance -- sometimes hysterical. I had to have a nurse to sit up with her at night.
What was the condition of Brunton's room -- after the disappearance?
===
Very orderly -- as usual. His clothes -- his watch -- even his money were in the room, but the black suit he usually wore was missing. His slippers, too were gone -- but not his boots.
Enlightening -- most enlightening. And what was the paper he had in his hand when you surprised him in the library? 
===
It was the Musgrave Ritual.
The Musgrave Ritual? What is that?
===
Oh rather an absurd business. It has only it's antiquity to excuse it. It's a strange sort of catechism which each Musgrave must answer when he becomes of age.
Could I see it?
===
FOOTSTEPS
Hmm -- this old hall is rather impressive with all its armor and weapons. Wait! I fancy I heard someone on the stairs -- someone on tiptoe.
===
STEPS UP STAIRS, RECEDING
Be careful -- my dear fellow -- be careful. 
===
No -- there's no one here.
Strange -- I would have sworn I heard footsteps.
===
Must have been the old stairs creaking. This is the library and this is the desk where I keep my private papers. 
How private? I mean -- is there anything there that would benefit anyone else?
===
Good heavens - no.
Nothing that might lead to blackmail?
===
No -- sorry to disappoint you, Holmes. But I've led a very tame and uninteresting life.
I see one of the drawers was broken into -- very amateurish -- I'm afraid Brunton had very little experience
===
And here is the Musgrave Ritual.
Hmm -- curious old writing -- it dates back to -- ah -- Charles the First I should say. You can tell by the spelling. 
===
Probably Charles the Second -- my ancestor Ralph Musgrave was a prominent cavalier and right hand man in Charles' wanderings. They went in for rigamarolle of this sort in those days. It's just a series of questions and answers. Probably the bywords of a secret society.
You know the answers by heart, I take it. 
===
Yes -- it's something every Musgrave has to learn.
Suppose I read off the questions -- and you give me the answers.
===
Fire away -- you can't trip me up there. 
All right -- here goes. Whose was it? 
===
His who is gone.
Who shall have it? 
===
He who will come. 
Where was the sun? 
===
Over the oak. 
Where was the shadow? 
===
North by ten - and by ten - east by five, and by five -south by two, and by two - west by one, and by one - and so under.
What shall we give for it?
===
All that is ours.
Why should we give it?
===
For the sake of the trust. As you can see, Holmes -- the paper has no practical importance.
On the contrary, it has tremendous practical importance. Your butler seems to have been a very clever fellow. He has had more insight than ten generations of his masters.
===
I say, Holmes --
The oak I take it is the one that stands here -- to the east of the house. I noticed it as I drove up.
===
That's right -- you can see it from this window.
Yes -- quite a patriarch.
===
It must have been here when the ritual was drawn up.
It was there at the Norman Conquest in all probability. Listen! There is someone in the hall outside -- eavesdropping. I'm sure of it this time.
===
You'll never find him -- never--I know where he's gone.
Yes?
===
He's gone where he belongs.
Where is that?
===
I say -- she's delirious -- help me to get her upstairs, will you? We'll have to postpone our talk I'm afraid.
Yes -- there's nothing more to do until tomorrow morning in any case.
===
What do you mean tomorrow morning?
When the sun is over the oak.
===
Good morning, Holmes - I hope you haven't been too bored prowling around the grounds by yourself. Sorry to have kept you waiting for breakfast. Fact is, I'm a bit upset. There's been another disappearance. Rachel eluded her nurse again last night, and so far, she hasn't been found. 
So I understand. Your now butler told me. I've traced her foot-prints to the edge of this lake.
===
But the lake is over eight feet deep at this point. Oh, the poor demented girl!
I took the liberty of ordering the drags and grappling hooks at once.
===
Yes. I see the men working. Have you found -- 
Nothing -- exactly nothing -- hello, there seems to be some excitement now. The drags have caught on something. 
===
That's right -- what a frightful business. Hello -- why, why -- it's not a body!
No, it's a large canvas bag.
===
Yes sir. 
What's in it?
===
Why - why it's just a lot of old discolored metal and some dull colored pebbles or glass. Bah! Throw it back in.
Stop! Better keep that stuff - bring it along - and don't let it out of your hands. Now let's get back to the house.
===
Breakfast - eh?
No, breakfast will have to be postponed. The sun is now over the oak.
===
I say, Holmes - you're not taking that rubbish seriously?
The only thing that puzzles me is the absence of our ancient elm tree.
===
Sorry to disappoint you. There are plenty of elderly beeches - won't they do?
No. I'm afraid not.
===
Wait a minute - there used to be an elm - very ancient it was, too - over there - you can still see the stump. It was cut down when I was about fifteen.
Hmm - that's better - midway between the house and the oak. Yes - that must have been the one. I suppose it's impossible to find out how tall it was. 
===
Not at all. It was sixty four feet.
Excellent! But how in --
===
That tree was my tutor's favorite exercise in trigonometry.
Now then - the shadow of the oak is fairly obvious - we can see that for ourselves - but the shadow of the elm is a bit more difficult.
===
I say, Holmes - what are you doing with that fishing rod?
A fishing rod of six feet -- throws a shadow -- of -- ah -- let me see -- nine feet exactly. Quite simple. Therefore, a tree of sixty-four feet will throw a shadow of ninety six feet - and in the same direction. Where's my tape? Ah, yes -- ninety six feet -- ninety-six yes, here we are.
===
I must say, Holmes that's very neat.
That's just the beginning -- my dear fellow -- just the beginning -- north ten and ten -- ten steps by each foot I think that means.
===
That takes you parallel to the well of the old wing of the house.
Marked with a peg -- now five to the east- - yes, and two to the South.
===
I say - it takes you to that old unused door.
The old unused door has been used quite recently. The surrounding ivy is all torn.
===
Yes, by Jove - it's even unlocked.
How long since this wing has been inhabited?
===
Not for several generations. It's the oldest part of the house - built in the sixteenth century, I should say. It's only used nowadays to store things in.
Open the door.
===
FOOTSTEPS ON STONE
Well, this must be the place indicated by the ritual.
===
What are you tapping the stones for?
All firmly cemented together -- not even a hollow sound! 
===
I told you it was all Balderdash.
Hold on -- "And so under" -- I nearly forgot that one. Is there a cellar under this place?
===
Yes, it's as old as the house.
Lead me to it -- that's where our search ends. 
===
That's it - this is the cellar - we store wood down here sometimes. Hello - it'' all been moved to the side.
What's this - what's this?
===
It's Brunton's muffler -- what's the villain been doing down here?
Just as I thought. Look here - this piece of wood - it's been used to prop up something heavy. See how both ends are flattened.
===
Look - the muffler's attached to this iron ring - set in the flagstone.
Quite sizeable flagstone, eh? He must have had some one to help him. He couldn't raise that by himself.
===
You mean Brunton?
Yes - he was after the buried treasure. He probably talked Rachel into assisting him -- that's how she happened to be in possession of the bag she threw into the lake.
===
I don't understand what you're talking about. 
Hmmm - I can't budge it. Lend a hand, will you Musgrave? 
===
CREAK OF HINGES
Quick - prop it up with that piece of wood
===
THUD
That's it --
===
By Jove -- it's -- it's a small room down there -- and there on the side -- what's that?
That my dear Musgrave - is what Brunton was after. Come on -- let's go down.
===
A brass bound wooden box - all covered with dust and worm eaten. The lid has been thrown back. Look here, Holmes -I thought you expected to find a considerable treasure. All this trunk contains is a few discolored discs of metal -- old coins apparently. I say, do you think that rascal Brunton has been here and robbed me?
That was his intention undoubtedly, but I don't think he succeeded.
===
Why not? The box is empty.
Because I think I see his feet sticking out from behind the box. Here -- help me move the box.
===
It's Brunton alright -- he's -- he's dead!
Quite. Suffocated, I fancy -- this cubbyhole isn't very large.
===
Yes, but how -- how did it happen?
He was murdered on the second night -- after you discovered him in the library. I can reconstruct the scene fairly easily from the data we have on hand -- Rachel's condition -- the bag found in the lake -- the open door -- the muffler -- and the piece of wood used as a prop. It is the last which is particularly significant He had talked Rachel into assisting him -- realizing that the girl was still infatuated They waited until everyone had gone to bed -- then stole down here. It was a stormy night I believe----
===
I say, Holmes -- what a cad he must have been. 
Quite.
===
But, what did Brunton find that he considered so valuable? 
The contents of that bag.
===
This old rubbish! Why, the metal is almost black and these dull looking stones --
Try rubbing one of them -- that reddish one, for instance.
===
Righto -- I say, I say - it develops quite a sparkle. 
Quite - I imagine that stuff was left in your ancestors' possession by the royal party on the death of Charles first. I congratulate you on its discovery. It is of great intrinsic value but of even greater importance as a historical curiosity.
===
Why, what is it then?
It is nothing less than the ancient crown of the Kings of England!
===
* SNEAK IN ON CUE. UP STRONG ON WATSON'S LAST LINE, THEN DOWN AND UNDER
Watson, d'you know my most treasured memory of our recent encounter with the white elephant of Parbutipur?
===
I imagine it was when the Maharajah gave you that check for ten-thousand pounds.
On the contrary, Watson. It was the night you came into the palace in a great state of excitement after you'd shot at a tiger cub. You told us how a shotgun had come on to your veranda and that you had fired a double-barrelled tiger cub at it.
===
Yes, I'm inclined to get a little incoherent when I get excited! Holmes--you remember in The Sign of Four how I got so flustered with Mr. Sholto that I cautioned him against the great danger of taking more than two drops of castor oil and then recommended strychnine in large doses as a sedative!
Strychnine can be a very efficient sedative. Well, let's get the bill. I'd like to take a walk through the native markets before we retire. See if you can attract the attention of our waiter.
===
The bill. Goodness gracious, they can't even speak English.
Why should they? Sahib-ke hissab dough.
===
Hissab! Bought atcha, hasoor.
Watson, you're a perfect example of the insular Englishman. I'm surprised at you. I should have thought you've lived in India long enough to have a smattering of the language.
===
I do know the language--but up in the Northwest we spoke a different lingo. And where did you learn to speak Hindustani I'd like to know?
Three months in Parbutipur has given me a working knowledge, at least.
===
Well, I must say...
Look, Watson. Here comes the manager in a great state of excitement and he's making a bee-line for our table.
===
Could you please come to Room 106 at once? One of our servants has been bitten by a rat--a giant rat--and he's lying up there having convulsions.
Convulsions from a rat bite? Of course my friend will come up. Come on, Watson! Never mind your brandy!
===
SCUFFLE OF FEET... GROANS OF BODY BEING LIFTED IN BACKGROUND
Before you go, where is this... er, giant rat now? And where is its owner?
===
Escaped? What d'you mean it escaped? It must be found. Why the blazes don't you train your servants to mind their own business?
May I suggest you calm yourself, Mr. Jackson. Your rat--so I have just been told--is trapped in the bathroom there.
===
And who are you, may I ask?
My name is Holmes. Sherlock Holmes, and this is my friend Doctor Watson.
===
Sherlock Holmes! I've heard of you. Aren't you the English detective?
I am flattered that my fame has spread so far afield. But don't look worried, Mr. Jackson, I'm not in your room in any professional capacity. My friend Doctor Watson was called in to attend the bitten man. I am here because I was very curious to see how a rat bite could produce convulsions.
===
DOOR OPEN AND CLOSE QUICKLY
Watson, that bitten man had all the symptoms of poisoning, didn't he?
===
Yes, he did. I can't understand it.
No. Rat bites might cause an infection, but never the symptoms that poor fellow exhibited. Hmm. Very curious. Why does our friend in there keep a rat in his hotel room?
===
Don't worry, Doctor. He can't get out. What'd you think of him, Mr. Holmes?
I can't say I'm exactly a rat fancier, Mr. Jackson. But he certainly is a giant. The thing that puzzles me is that his bite has produced the symptoms of acute poisoning in that unfortunate man that was just carried out. How do you account for that?
===
If you gentlemen have a few moments, I'd like to tell you the story of that rat. I think it will help you to understand what's just happened.
I should be very interested to hear the story, Mr. Jackson.
===
How about you, Mr. Holmes?
Thank you, no. Alcohol is one of the few vices I don't indulge in.
===
Good heavens! What a shocking thing.
Human sacrifices for a rodent, eh? Go on, Mr. Jackson.
===
Downright disgusting.
Quiet, Watson.
===
My interest was purely that of the collector. And so I slipped away from the village with my prize in a cage and caught the next boat for Calcutta. I wanted to talk to the curator of the Calcutta Zoo about buying a specimen of their Himalayan tree bear whilst I was there. But my erstwhile friends in Sumatra have not been idle. I've been followed. Two attempts have been made to take the rat back. One attempt has been made on my life already. I think what happened just now was a third attempt to steal the rat.
Very possibly, Mr. Jackson, but I still don't understand the symptoms of poisoning.
===
I think that what undoubtedly happened was that the man just carried out was attempting to drug or poison the rat so that he could handle it. Even a dead Sumatra rat is an object of veneration amongst the tribe. Probably he opened the cage and tried to feed the poison to the rat. Possibly the rat got some on his fangs and then bit him.
You should have been a detective, Mr. Jackson. That's an ingenious deduction... though I can't say I find it an entirely convincing one.
===
Why not, Holmes? It's a most interesting case.
I'm afraid not, Mr. Jackson. I'm on a holiday now and I want to relax.
===
Well, 'pon my soul. I've never heard you turn down a case like this before.
However, we shall be here for a couple of days yet. And Doctor Watson and myself are neighbors of yours. We are in Suite 109... just down the corridor from you, so please feel free to call on us if you have any more trouble. And now, Watson, let's take that stroll. I want to observe the night life of Calcutta.
===
INDIAN FLUTE PLAYING SNAKE-CHARMING THEME. BAZAAR AD-LIBS IN BACKGROUND
Watson, observe the trance-like condition of that snake. See... the glazed eyes... the immobile body... Fascinating. Quite fascinating. The powers of music are often more potent in the animal kingdom than in the human.
===
INDIAN FLUTE CEASES
Give that fellow a rupee. He's given us a fine performance.
===
Salaam, Sahib. Burra Salaam.
Let's explore the Bazaar a little further.
===
FOOTSTEPS ON STONE. INDIAN FLUTE STARTS IN BACKGROUND AGAIN AND FADES AWAY
So you're worried, my dear fellow because I didn't accept Mr. Jackson's commission?
===
I'm not worried, Holmes. I'm just surprised.
Well, don't be, old fellow. I'm very much interested in the case. But sometimes one has a greater... ah, latitude of behaviour in a case when one is observing it from the outside. If Mr. Jackson thinks he needs protection, he should apply to the official police.
===
But if you are interested in the case, why are we wandering through this bazaar? Why aren't we back at the hotel keeping an eye on Jackson and his wretched rat?
We are going back to the hotel, Watson. But first of all I have a visit to make. This apparently aimless stroll is taking us to the Calcutta Zoo. I want to have a little chat with the curator there. You know Watson, I have a feeling that before this night is out, the giant rat of Sumatra will bite again!
===
It's nearly one o'clock in the morning. D'you think you ought to keep scraping away at that violin? There are people trying to sleep, y'know.
Nonsense.
===
VIOLIN BREAKS OFF MELODY
Confound it! What can't I capture that snake-charming melody?
===
Holmes, did you learn anything from the curator tonight? I listened to your discussion, but I'll be hanged if I could understand a word either of you were talking about.
You're a medical man. You should at least have found it as understandable as I did.
===
VIOLIN COMPLETES THEME, THEN FINISHES WITH A LITTLE FLOURISH
That's it! At last I've got it.
===
VIOLIN BEING PLACED ON TABLE
Now I can go to bed.
===
Well, thank heavens for that. I must say I'm ready to turn in myself. You still haven't answered my question, Holmes.
Hmm... question? What question?
===
I asked whether you learnt anything from your discussion over at the zoo tonight?
Oh yes. I learnt a great deal. A very great deal. In fact I may say that--
===
Good Heavens! D'you hear that? That came from Jackson's room!
Quick, Watson!
===
RUNNING FOOTSTEPS. DOOR OPEN. FOOTSTEPS ON SLIGHT ECHO
Have you got your revolver with you?
===
No... shall I go back for it?
Never mind, I have mine. Here we are--
===
Back! Get back there!
Watson! See what you can do for that poor fellow there. I'll take care of the rat.
===
No, Mr. Holmes! Put that revolver away! I'll get the rat back in the cage, but don't shoot it! It's too valuable.
You'd better hurry then. Here... throw this bedspread over it!
===
There! The rat's back in the cage!
Just in time, Mr. Jackson. I was about to bring your pet's career to an abrupt end.
===
The man's dead, Holmes. Poor devil... look at that expression on his face... the contorted features... the staring eyeballs... the arched back.
Exactly. All the symptoms of strychnine poisoning! Mr. Jackson, I'm afraid your chances of taking the rat back to America are very slight. I think you'll find the police will insist on killing him and performing an autopsy.
===
Two-thirty in the morning and still the police haven't arrived.
Patience, Watson. They'll be here.
===
This is terrible. Mr. Holmes, you really think they'll kill my rat?
It's hard for me to predict what the police will do, but personally I can see no alternative. The rat has bitten and killed one man, and severely poisoned another. The cause of death looks like strychnine poisoning. It seems obvious that if the rat bite did kill the man, the first thing to do is to dissect the rat and discover how it was able to deliver this lethal bite.
===
What d'you mean "if" the rat bite killed him? We know it did.
We know it bit him.
===
What is your theory, Mr. Holmes?
I never theorize. By the way, Mr. Jackson--being a zoologist you are naturally familiar with the Tamana... the Tamana... the Darjeeling snow bird?
===
Oh, yes... Yes, of course.
There's an excellent specimen that's just arrived at the zoo. We saw it earlier on today.
===
Darjeeling snow bird? I don't remember any--
You never remember anything, my dear fellow. Mr. Jackson: The man who was killed here in this room tonight. Have you ever seen him before?
===
Never.
Are you still of the opinion that he was employed by the tribe in Sumatra to recapture the sacred animal?
===
KNOCK ON DOOR
Ah... that must be the police now.
===
Mr. Sherlock Holmes? I am very honored to meet you, Mr. Holmes. We in the Indian Police service are very familiar with your brilliant work in Europe.
Thank you.
===
Also your recent handling of the case of the white elephant for the Maharajah of Parbutipur. I am flattered to be associated with you in this case.
I'm merely a spectator, Inspector. Pray proceed as though I were not present.
===
Undoubtedly the dead man's life was worth even more to him. No, Mr. Jackson, your rat will have to die. I shall return within the hour with the necessary authority to take the rat for dissection. Before I leave, I'd like the exact facts as to the tragedy tonight.
I think if you'll excuse me, gentlemen, I'll turn in. Are you coming Watson? It's a quarter-to-three in the morning.
===
Yes, I suppose so, though I must say I'm surprised at your leaving...
There is nothing further we can do. Inspector Singh is in efficient command. Good night, Inspector. Good night, Mr. Jackson.
===
Holmes, I just don't understand your handling of this case. Walking out just as the police walk in.
Don't you, Watson? There was nothing more to be learned in there--merely a recapitulation of what we already know. Come into the room and I'll tell you my plans.
===
I'll never get any sleep tonight.
Perhaps not. But think of the satisfied sleep you can have on the boat--when the case of the Giant Rat is solved.
===
Good Lord, Holmes. You think you've solved it?
Almost, my dear fellow. Almost. There is just one more thing to be done... and it's a job for you.
===
Of course, Holmes. What is it?
I must examine that rat before it is taken away. You must get Jackson out as soon as Singh leaves. I don't care what excuse you make, but get him out of the hotel for half-an-hour.
===
Of course I'll do it. But I say, Holmes... be careful when you get near that rat.
Don't worry, old fellow. I've learnt quite a bit about the behaviour of rats from our visit to the zoo today. Also, you will observe that pair of leather gloves lying on the table there. No, I'm taking no chances. Within an hour from now, I think I can promise you the solution to the case!
===
Well, Holmes, I got our friend Jackson to come out and have a drink with me. He's gone back to his room now. Did I give you enough time?
You've done splendidly Watson. Splendidly. I have completed my examination of the rat and laid all my plans, and there's no time to waste. Better bring your revolver.
===
Revolver? What do I--?
Don't argue. Do as I say. This is a matter of life and death.
===
Oh, all right. Here it is on the table.
Now follow me...
===
FOOTSTEPS... DOOR OPEN AND CLOSE. FOOTSTEPS CONTINUE
Quickly, Watson... in here...
===
But this isn't Jackson's room... this is 104.
This is the room next to his. It's empty and I have obtained the key. Come in.
===
What on earth are you up to, Holmes?
You'll soon see. We open those French windows...
===
WINDOW BEING OPENED
So... and what do we find?
===
By Jove! A balcony!
Exactly. A balcony that extends under Mr. Jackson's window. Now slip off your shoes, Watson, and keep your voice down. Come on. We'll have a grandstand seat. And keep your revolver handy... Here we go...
===
FAINT SHUFFLE OF FEET. SOUNDS OF EXERTION
Here we are, Watson. This gives us a view of the whole room.
===
Yes. There's Jackson sitting facing the door... and the rat's beside him on the table. I hope that cage is securely fastened.
Shh... Here comes Inspector Singh now. We've timed this perfectly... keep your eyes peeled...
===
Singh's got the warrant. They seem to be arguing about it... Singh's moving towards the cage... Look! Jackson's opening the cage Great heavens! He's thrown it on the floor! The rat's loose!
Exactly! And here comes Jackson now! Grab him, Watson! He's trying to get out this way. I'll get the rat!
===
Let me go!
Look out, Singh! Move away from there!
===
REVOLVER SHOT. YELP OF RAT
And that, I think, is the end of the rat. Watson, bring Mr. Jackson back in here.
===
This is all a ridiculous mistake!
Inspector Singh, I don't know whether a pair of handcuffs is part of your regular equipment?
===
Yes, Mr. Holmes.
Then I suggest you slip them on our friend Mr. Jackson here. He's your murderer.
===
I'll get you for this, Holmes! You see if I don't!
Hardly. The gallows will get you first.
===
Nor do I. Will you stop keeping us in the dark any longer, Holmes, and tell us how the devil you know that Jackson is the murderer?
With pleasure. Let me first slip on these leather gloves. Even in death our rat can still be extremely lethal. Now, gentlemen, to be technical, here is the weapon that was used to commit the murder. This rat. First of all let me point out the fang here. It's really an extremely clever piece of dental work. The center of the tooth has been drilled hollow and in the cavity has been inserted a tiny hypodermic needle--a needle containing strychnine. On biting anything--a natural impulse in a rat--the needle would puncture the skin, injecting strychnine, and so producing immediate death. Ingenious isn't it?
===
I'll tell you nothing. Ask Mr. Sherlock Holmes. He seems to know everything.
Certainly I'll tell you. Your guess isn't a bad one, Watson. The rat was equipped with a device for protecting itself from capture--but not from a Pygmy Tribe in Sumatra who worship rats. That was a colourful story invented by Mr. Jackson. There are no Pygmies in Sumatra, but there are Pygmies in the Andaman Islands some three-hundred miles away. If you read your papers thoroughly, you will recall that some five weeks ago, the famous Hapang diamond was stolen from the head of the idol worshipped by the Andaman Islanders.
===
Good heavens! But where is the diamond now?
If you will observe the underside of the belly of this rat, you will notice this large bulge. When you perform your autopsy, Mr. Singh, you will find the Hapang diamond cleverly inserted between the skin and the flesh of the dead rat. A very ingenious safe for your treasure, Mr. Jackson--a safe that defends itself with a bite of death. But I'm afraid you reckoned without meeting Sherlock Holmes.
===
Great heavens! He's gone. Through the window and over the balcony. Poor devil!
I should save your sympathy, Watson. A man who kills with a rat must expect to die like one!
===
On a windy morning in October -- in 1890, it was -- as I was dressing, I observed how the last remaining leaves were being whirled away from the solitary plane tree which graced the yard behind our Baker Street house. I descended to breakfast prepared to find my companion in depressed spirits, for, like all great artists, he was easily impressed by his surroundings. But, to my surprise, he was in an unusually gay mood. As I entered the room, he looked up at me and, with a smile, he spoke.
Good morning, my dear fellow. I hope you slept well.
===
Splendidly, thanks, Holmes.
I'm so glad.
===
Well, you're very solicitous this morning. I - I think you must have got a new case. Am I right?
The faculty of deduction is certainly contagious. Yes, I have a new case. After a month of trivialities and stagnation, the wheels revolve once more.
===
Good. Tell me all about it.
Well, as yet, there isn't much to tell. Have you ever heard of Neil Gibson?
===
Neil Gibson? Oh, yes, yes, yes. Something to do with gold mining, hasn't he?
A great deal to do with it, my dear fellow. In fact, he's considered the greatest mining magnate in the world. About five years ago, he bought a large estate in Hampshire. Perhaps you've read of the tragic death of his wife.
===
Oh, yes, of course. I remember the case now. She was murdered by a jealous governess who was in her employ, wasn't she?
That point will be decided when the lady in question -- Grace Dunbar, I believe her name is -- comes up for trial at the forthcoming Winchester Assizes. In any case, it's hard to see what I can do for my client at this late date.
===
Your client?
Oh, yes. I forgot I hadn't told you. I'm getting into your involved habit of telling a story backwards. You'd better read this letter; came this morning.
===
Let's have a look. "Dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes, Miss Dunbar is innocent. I can't see the finest woman in the world go to her death without doing everything possible to save her. I shall call on you at ten-thirty to-morrow morning to discuss the matter. Yours faithfully, Neil Gibson." Good gracious me.
There you have it, Watson. That is the gentleman I await. 
===
Do you know anything about his dead wife?
Only what I've been reading in the papers. Apparently, she was past her prime, which was the more unfortunate as this Miss Dunbar, who superintended the education of the two young children, is reputed to be a very attractive young lady.
===
The eternal triangle, eh? Well, where did the murder take place?
On Gibson's estate in Hampshire. His wife was found on the grounds nearly half a mile from the manor house, late at night, clad in her dinner dress, with a shawl over her shoulders and -- a revolver bullet through her brain. 
===
Any weapon found near her?
No, there were no clues found at the scene of the crime.
===
What made them suspect the governess?
Well, in the first place, there was some very incriminating evidence. A revolver with one discharged chamber -- the calibre corresponding with the bullet in the dead woman's head -- was found on the floor in Miss Dunbar's wardrobe.
===
Oh, was it? Pretty damaging evidence, Holmes.
Mmm. So the coroner thought. And, to make the case even blacker against Miss Dunbar, the dead woman had a note on her making an appointment at that very spot -- and the note was signed by the governess.
===
It seems obvious that the girl's guilty. And the motive's clear. Mr. Gibson would be a great catch for a young girl. Love, fortune, power -- all dependent on one life. 
Possibly, Watson, but circumstantial evidence can be very misleading at times.
===
Mrs. Hudson's opening the door to him now.
Ah, meet him on the stairs, will you, old chap? It'll save Mrs. Hudson a journey.
===
That's right. So you're the great Sherlock Holmes, huh?
The adjective is your own, Mr. Gibson. Sit down, won't you? By the way, you may speak quite freely in front of Dr. Watson.
===
Hm. Well, I may as well begin by telling you that money means nothing to me in this case. You can burn it if it's any use to you in lighting the truth. Miss Dunbar is innocent and it's up to you to prove it. Just name your fee.
Mr. Gibson, my professional charges are on a fixed scale. I don't vary them, except when I omit them altogether.
===
Very well. I imagine that you read the newspaper reports of the coroner's inquest.
Yes, very thoroughly.
===
I don't see that I can add anything that'll help you. But if there are any questions you'd like to ask, I'll answer them.
Well, thank you. First, what were the exact relations between you and Miss Dunbar?
===
I suppose you're within your rights in asking such a question, Mr. Holmes.
We will agree to suppose so, shall we?
===
Then I can assure you that my relations with Miss Dunbar were always those of an employer towards a young lady whom he never conversed with, or ever saw, except in the company of his children.
Ohh. I'm rather a busy man, Mr. Gibson, and I've no time or taste for aimless conversation. I wish you good-morning.
===
What the devil do you mean by this, Mr. Holmes?
My dear sir, the case is difficult enough without your giving me false information.
===
Meaning that I lie, sir?
I was trying to express it as delicately as possible, but - - if you insist on the word I won't contradict you.
===
Why, you confounded--!
Don't be noisy, Mr. Gibson. Please, don't be noisy. I find that after breakfast even the smallest argument is unsettling. I suggest that a stroll in the morning air and a little quiet thought will be greatly to your advantage.
===
Upon my soul, Holmes, you were unusually severe with him.
I dislike liars, Watson, and I cannot tolerate arrogance -- particularly when it's coupled with great wealth.
===
How did you know about his relations with the governess?
I didn't. It was pure bluff.
===
Bluff! Well, it certainly worked. Think he'll come back?
Oh, of course he will. He needs my help too badly. He'll probably change his mind before he's halfway down the stairs.
===
I've been thinking it over, Mr. Holmes, and I feel that perhaps I was hasty in taking your remarks amiss. Just the same, I can assure you that the relations between Miss Dunbar and me really don't affect this case.
Surely, that is for me to decide, Mr. Gibson.
===
Fire away, Mr. Holmes. What is it you want to know?
The truth.
===
Yes, doctor, and very beautiful. Well, to make a long story short, I fell in love and married her and brought her to England. After a few years, I realized that we had nothing -- absolutely nothing -- in common. 
And then, I suppose, this young governess, Miss Dunbar, arrived on the scene.
===
Who could help it?
Did you suggest marriage to her?
===
Yes. Though I knew that my wife would never divorce me.
I see. Then you made an utterly insincere proposition to her.
===
Now, look here, Mr. Holmes, I came to you on a question of evidence, not of morals. I'm not asking for your criticism.
It's only the young lady's sake that forces me to touch your case at all. Now, tell me, sir. What is your own opinion as to Miss Dunbar's guilt?
===
It's very black against her, I can't deny that. One explanation of the tragedy did come into my head, Mr. Holmes. I give it to you, for what it's worth. 
Pray continue, Mr. Gibson.
===
My wife was bitterly jealous. She was half-crazy with hatred. She might have planned to murder Miss Dunbar -- or, we'll say, to threaten the girl with a revolver and so frighten her into leaving us. There might have been a struggle in which the gun exploded and gone off and shot my wife who was holding it.
Well, that possibility has already occurred to me. It's the only obvious alternative to deliberate murder.
===
The revolver, Holmes. It was found on the floor of the governess' wardrobe.
Mr. Gibson, I should like to examine your house and the scene of the murder as soon as possible.
===
Certainly, Mr. Holmes. Sergeant Coventry of the local police is still down there. He'll give you any help you may need.
Excellent! Watson, old fellow -- [?] the timetable! We're catching the next fast train to Winchester!
===
So if I have to have someone else on the case, I'd rather have you, Mr. 'Olmes. The Yard gets called in, then we local police loses all credit for success; generally gets blamed for the failures. Now, I've heard that you play straight.
I need not appear in the matter at all, Sergeant Coventry. If I can clear it up, I don't ask to even have my name mentioned.
===
Oh, nearly twice that, doctor. The woods back o' the house there belongs to him, too. Mr. 'Olmes?
Yes, sergeant?
===
There's a question I'd like to ask you. A question I wouldn't ask anyone else.
Then please ask it.
===
Don't you think there might be a case against Mr. Gibson hisself, sir?
I've been considering that possibility.
===
Yes, doctor. It was one of a pair that he had.
One of a pair? Where's the other?
===
Well, we 'ave 'em all laid out at the house if you want to look 'em over.
We'll do that later. 
===
That's right, sir. Found Mrs. Gibson's body lying right here at the approach to the bridge. 
I see. I gathered from the newspaper reports that the shot was fired at very close quarters.
===
Yes, sir, very close.
Near the right temple, wasn't it?
===
Oh, on its back, doctor. No trace of a struggle. No marks. No weapon. The note from Miss Dunbar was clutched in her left hand.
Clutched, you say?
===
Yes, sir, we could hardly open the fingers to get at it.
Ah, that's of greatest importance. It excludes the idea that anyone could have placed the note there after death in order to furnish a false clue. 
===
Little enough, doctor. It just said, uh, "I will be at Thor Bridge at nine o'clock" and it was signed "Grace Dunbar."
Did Miss Dunbar admit writing it?
===
Oh, yes, sir.
What was her explanation?
===
She wouldn't say nothing. Said she was saving her defence for the trial.
Yes, it seems odd that Mrs. Gibson was still clutching that note.
===
Seems perfectly natural to me.
Oh, come now, old fellow, argue the thing out logically. If the letter is genuine, it was certainly received some time before the tragedy -- say an hour or two. Why, then, was the dead woman still clasping it in her left hand? Why should she carry it so carefully? She certainly didn't need to refer to the note at all at the interview. Doesn't it strike you as rather strange?
===
Well, now, you put it that way, it does seem a little peculiar.
Hello!
===
Not a very large chip.
Yes, but it's been done recently. Notice how the stonework is white just here. It took some violence to do that. Hand me your cane, Watson, will you?
===
Here you are.
Thanks.
===
Yes, Holmes, I don't see how it could have any connection with Mrs. Gibson's murder.
Well, perhaps it hasn't. But it's a point worth noting. There were no footprints, you say, sergeant?
===
None, Mr. 'Olmes. The ground was as hard as iron. It's been a very dry summer and we haven't had any rain to speak of.
That's a pity. Hmm. Well, sergeant, I'm much obliged to you and now I think we'll go back to the house.
===
Right. Cesar'll show you where the firearms are, sir.
Oh, uh, who is Cesar?
===
Oh, a funny kind of a bloke. Brazilian, I guess.
Brazilian, eh? Like Mrs. Gibson?
===
Yes, Mr. 'Olmes. Comes from the same town as she does, as a matter of fact. Something very fishy about 'im, if you ask me. Now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen, I'm going to take a little stroll around the grounds. You've started me on a new train of thought in this case, Mr. 'Olmes.
I'm delighted, sergeant. [Come, Watson, let's] get back to the house.
===
BRIDGE
I see. And these are all the firearms in Mr. Gibson's possession, eh, Cesar?
===
Mr. Gibson have many enemies, señor. He always sleep with a loaded pistol beside his bed. He is a man of great violence. There have been times when all of us were afraid of him. 
Did you ever witness physical violence towards Mrs. Gibson?
===
No, señor, I cannot say that I have. But I have heard him say many terrible things to her. He would taunt her in front of we servants. I have heard him do it many times.
Thank you, Cesar, that will be all.
===
You know, Holmes, I still think the case against Miss Dunbar looks very black.
I should agree with you if it were not for one fact -- the finding of the revolver in her wardrobe.
===
Upon my soul, Holmes. That seems to me the strongest evidence of all.
I think not, old chap.
===
Huh?
We must look for consistency. Where there is a want of it, we must suspect deception.
===
I don't quite follow you.
Suppose for a moment that we visualize you in the character of a woman who, in cold, premeditated fashion, is about to murder a rival. You've planned it. A note has been written. The victim has come. You have a weapon. The crime is well done. It has been workmanlike and complete. Do you mean to tell me that after carrying out so crafty a crime you'd be so stupid as to forget to fling the incriminating revolver to the bottom of the stream? Or perhaps in the dense reeds that border it? Would you carefully carry it home and put it in the first place that would be searched? Your wardrobe?
===
Well, perhaps in the excitement of the moment--
No, no, my dear chap, I won't admit that's even possible. When a crime is coolly premeditated, then the means of covering it are coolly premeditated also. 
===
Well then, if Miss Dunbar didn't shoot Mrs. Gibson, who the devil did?
I hope I can give you the answer to that question, Watson, when we've made one further visit.
===
Oh, Lord. Where are we going now?
To prison, old chap.
===
Prison?
Yes, we're going to Winchester Prison to call on Miss Dunbar. I'm certain that the key to this strange mystery lies in her hands.
===
We did, Mr. Bartell. An hour later found the two of us sitting in a dank and gloomy cell talking to one of the most beautiful girls that I've ever seen. Her bright, flashing eyes and her air of quiet confidence seemed sadly out of place in such a setting. Holmes spoke to her, quietly soothing her.
Miss Dunbar, tell us of your true relations with the dead woman.
===
She hated me, Mr. Holmes. She hated me with all the passion of her distorted mind.
Please tell us exactly what happened on the evening of Mrs. Gibson's death.
===
No, doctor. She-- Well, she asked me to destroy the note, so I burned it in the schoolroom grate. I saw no reason for such secrecy but-- Well, I - I did as she asked.
Hmm. And yet she kept your reply very carefully. That's interesting. Tell me what happened when you met her that night.
===
Within a few yards of the spot where her body was found later.
And yet, presuming she met her death shortly after you left her, you heard no shot?
===
No. No, I heard nothing. But I was so upset, Mr. Holmes, that I rushed straight back to my room.
Did you leave it again that night?
===
Yes, doctor. He had just returned from the bridge when I saw him. He had sent for the doctor and the police.
This pistol that [was] found in your room. Had you ever seen it before?
===
Next morning, when the police made their search. It was on the floor of my wardrobe where I keep my shoes.
Hm. You've no idea how long it had been there?
===
Well, it hadn't been there the morning before.
How do you know?
===
Because I tidied up the wardrobe that day.
I see. Then someone must have come into your room and placed the pistol there in order to incriminate you.
===
Well, it - it could have been at meal-time, or when I was in the schoolroom with the children.
Yes. Miss Dunbar, on examining the scene of Mrs. Gibson's death, I noticed that a piece of stonework on the underside of the parapet of the bridge had been broken away. Can you suggest any possible explanation for that?
===
Oh, surely, it must have been a mere coincidence, Mr. Holmes.
Possibly. But why should it appear at the very time of the tragedy, and at the very place? Could it possibly be that--? Why, yes, of course! Idiot! Why didn't I think of it before?! Come along, Watson!
===
Where are we going, Holmes?
Back to Thor Bridge, old fellow, as fast as we can get there!
===
What have you found out, Mr. Holmes?
The answer to this mystery I hope, my dear young lady. You will get news before the day is out. And meanwhile take my assurance that the clouds are lifting and that the light of truth is breaking through!
===
Well, Mr. 'Olmes, you're soon back here. What have you found out?
Tell you in a few moments. You got my message?
===
Yes, here you are, a ball of twine. What you want it for, I can't imagine.
You'll soon see, sergeant. Uh, Watson, I, uh, have some recollection that you usually go armed on these excursions of ours.
===
Yes, I'm carrying my revolver. Why?
Give it to me, old chap, will you? Thanks. I believe your revolver may have a very intimate connection with the mystery we're investigating.
===
You're joking.
No, Watson, I'm very serious. We have a test to make. If the test is successful, Miss Dunbar will be free before nightfall. And the test will depend on the conduct of this revolver of yours. 
===
Wish I knew what you was up to, sir.
I tie one end of the twine -- like this -- to the handle of the revolver. So. Sergeant, see if you can find me a heavy stone, will you?
===
Holmes, what are you doing?
Trying to reconstruct the killing of Mrs. Gibson. But you've seen me miss the mark before, Watson. I have an instinct for such things, and yet it has sometimes played me false. It seemed a certainty when it first flashed across my mind in Miss Dunbar's cell, but one drawback of an active mind is that one can always conceive alternative explanations which would make our scent a false one. And yet-- Oh, well. We can but try.
===
Here's a nice stone, Mr. Holmes.
Thank you, sergeant! Now! I tie the other end of this twine to a stone. Wait a minute. Like that. Splendid! Uh, sergeant, will you please take this stone and stretch the twine across the parapet of the bridge there -- so that the stone will swing just clear of the water on the other side of the bridge?
===
Right you are, sir.
I'll stand on the spot where Mrs. Gibson's body was found. That's it, sergeant. Over the parapet.
===
All set, Mr. Holmes. The stone's swinging about eight feet above the water.
Splendid! Now, Watson, watch closely. I raise the revolver to my head.
===
Careful, Holmes, careful.
Don't worry, old chap, it's not loaded. Now, let us imagine I am the late Mrs. Gibson. I raise the revolver to my head and fire it.
===
Great Scott! The revolver flashed back out of your hand -- struck the parapet of the bridge -- and then the weight of the stone flipped it over into the water!
Was there ever a more exact demonstration? Come on, old fellow!
===
You're a bloomin' magician, Mr. 'Olmes! That's what you are, a bloomin' magician!
Look at that! There's the second chip on the stonework of the parapet here -- same size as the first! 
===
Then the murder of Mrs. Gibson--?
Wasn't murder at all! It was suicide!
===
What?
We can follow the various steps quite clearly. A note was extracted very cleverly from Miss Dunbar. A note which made it appear that she had chosen the scene of the crime. Mrs. Gibson, in her anxiety that the note should be discovered, somewhat overdid it by holding it in her hand to the last. That alone should have excited my suspicions earlier than it did.
===
And planted the other one in Miss Dunbar's wardrobe!
Exactly! After discharging one of the cartridges, which she could easily do in the woods without attracting suspicion, she then went down to the bridge where she contrived this exceedingly ingenious method of getting rid of her weapon. When Miss Dunbar appeared, she used her last breath in pouring out her hatred, and then, when the girl had left, carried out her terrible purpose. 
===
Then the missing revolver--?
You'll find it, with the aid of a grappling hook, at the bottom of the stream, and also the stone and the string, with which this vindictive woman attempted to disguise her own crime and fasten a charge of murder on an innocent victim. 
===
I must say, Holmes, you've solved this case brilliantly. Quite brilliantly.
Ah, I disagree, old chap. And I fear that you will not improve my reputation by adding the case of the Thor Bridge mystery to your annals. 
===
Oh, nonsense. But that's ridiculous.
Oh, no, it isn't, old boy. I've been sluggish in my mind -- and wanting in that mixture of imagination and reality which is the very basis of my art. I confess that the chip in the stonework was a sufficient clue to suggest the true solution, and I blame myself for not having attained it sooner.
===
Well, Holmes, personally, I agree with the sergeant's opinion of you.
Oh? What was that, old fellow?
===
But, Mr. Holmes, you can't say you'll have nothing more to do with the Montrevors--
My dear Miss Tetfield, I found the true murderer of the Dowager Countess and he committed suicide. Surely the case has ended.
===
It's Douglas Milton that I'm talking about.
Oh, yes, yes, yes. He was the heir to the title, wasn't he?
===
Yes, Mr. Holmes. He was a sensitive, artistic boy and - and when he knew that he was under suspicion, he ran away.
Mm hm.
===
We were engaged to be married when he ran away. Mr. Holmes, you've got to find him. He must know that his name has been cleared and that he's inherited the title. 
Miss Tetfield, have you any direct news, any letter, from your fiancé since he left five years ago? 
===
None.
Any clues as to his hiding place?
===
It's a painting I received anonymously a year after he had left.
Oh.
===
It was sent from a forwarding address in London. Here it is, Mr. Holmes.
Thank you.
===
A small oil painting. Very good one, too, I'd say.
Yes. It's a splendid sense of composition and his use of color is unusually brilliant. Do you recognize this painting as the work of your fiancé, Miss Tetfield?
===
I'm certain of it.
Yes. Wonderful use of color. Observe the delicate shadings of that sunset, and the brilliant green of the oasis. This scene is extraordinarily reminiscent of the desert in North Africa. 
===
But why should he go to North Africa?
A good place, Watson, for an Englishman who imagines himself to be escaping justice. Remember, the Foreign Legion is stationed there.
===
Do you think he might have joined the Legion, Mr. Holmes?
It would seem logical. No questions are asked of those who join it and its colorful obscurity might easily appeal to a young fellow in trouble. Hello!
===
What is it, Holmes?
There are quite a few grains of sand in-between the canvas and the frame here. Miss Tetfield, do you mind if I pry the canvas loose?
===
Do anything you like, Mr. Holmes, if it gives you any clue to Douglas' whereabouts.
Give me your pen knife, will you, Watson?
===
Here you are.
Thanks, old chap. 
===
CUTS CANVAS FROM FRAME BEHIND--
Wait a minute. Here we are. 
===
Can you see anything?
Uh huh. Look! The words "Sheriff" and "El Affroun" are stamped here. Sheriff is probably the framer's name and El Affroun is a town some fifty miles from Algiers. That settles it. Miss Tetfield, I accept your case. Watson and I will go to Africa and try to find your fiancé, Douglas Milton.
===
Monsieur Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. I have heard of you so often, but I never thought I should see you here at the headquarters of the Foreign Legion. What can I do for you, gentlemen?
Well, Colonel De Brisson, I am trying to trace an Englishman who has been missing during the past four years. I've reason to believe that he might have joined the Legion.
===
Let me see. Four years ago would be Eighteen Ninety-Five. If Sherlock Holmes is tracking him, then I suppose he was in trouble in his own country. If he was in trouble, he might easily have come to us. We ask no questions. Ninety-seven, ninety-six-- Ah! Ninety-five! In that year, three young Englishmen joined us. One of them died of dysentery two years ago in Sidi Rached. One of them deserted eighteen months ago and we have been unable to trace him. The third is my adjutant who brought you into my office just now.
And he is, I would say, about three inches shorter than Douglas Milton -- and men do not shrink in the Foreign Legion, eh, Colonel?
===
Then the fellow who deserted must be our man.
Unless it's the one who died of dysentery. Colonel De Brisson, how would you advise us to set about trying to find a deserter?
===
Monsieur Holmes, there's only one place in Algeria where a man can hide from the Foreign Legion and remain hidden.
Oh? And what's that place?
===
The Casbah, in Algiers.
Then that's our destination, Watson. 
===
Be very careful, please, gentlemen. The Casbah is a place where the law is exiled. The police have no jurisdiction there. The only rule is that of strength, violence and trickery.
We shall be very cautious, I assure you. Goodbye, Colonel De Brisson, and thank you for your help.
===
Well, I must say that I think Colonel De Brisson rather exaggerated the dangers of the Casbah. Heh! I suppose you're going to tell me this café is the headquarters for a dope-smuggling ring or white slaving or something.
It's ramifications are even more extensive than those you've mentioned. 
===
You're joking, Holmes.
I assure you, I'm not, old fellow. 
===
What?
My old friend Duemmel is Chief of Police in Algiers. When I told him our mission, he advised me to come here. A five-hundred-franc note and the proprietor can obtain any and all information regarding the underworld. For as little as two hundred francs, he can arrange a murder. So that gives you some idea of the relative values in the Casbah.
===
Good lord; then you've already spoken to the proprietor?
Oh, yes, yes, a charming scoundrelly fellow by the name of Rafi. I gave him five hundred francs and asked him to set his underworld grapevine in motion to see whether an Englishman living in hiding here in the Casbah could be found.
===
EASTERN MELODY OUT
Here comes Rafi now. Let's hope he has news for us. Here we are, Rafi! Come sit down, won't you?
===
Ah, Rafi works fast, does he not, Mr. Holmes? Uh, your friend is--?
My friend knows that you're working with me. What have you found out?
===
Oui, M'sieu Rafi!
Uh, you have news for me, then?
===
But yes. 
Good. What is it?
===
First, you will pay me more money, no?
But I gave you five hundred francs. You said that you'd do the job for that.
===
COINS TOSSED ON TABLE
There you are.
===
My information is a bargain at seven hundred and fifty francs. It would be a bargain at a thousand, but Rafi will let you have it for seven hundred and fifty because he likes you.
I see.
===
You will give it to me, no?
And if I refuse?
===
I get the money, no?
You're a scoundrel, Rafi.
===
Of course I am a scoundrel!
Here's your money. The information?
===
There is an Englishman hiding here in the Casbah. I do not know his name, but he's tall and fair-haired. I cannot tell you where he lives, but if you go to the Café of a Thousand Sighs, you will find a girl who sings there -- a girl who sings like a nightingale. Her name is Ayisha and she can lead you to your Englishman.
A girl named Ayisha, in the Café of a Thousand Sighs?
===
That is right. I would suggest that you go there in disguise. Two well-dressed Englishmen might find themselves in trouble. For a small fee -- say, two hundred francs -- I will escort you there myself.
Thank you, thank you, yes. I - I think we can manage by ourselves, Rafi.
===
Oh, uh, if your business is concluded quickly and time weighs heavy on your hands, Rafi can take you to some places of rare interest -- dancing girls that wither one's eyeballs with their beauty! For five hundred francs, gentlemen--
Thank you, Rafi, thank you. I have a feeling that time will not weigh heavily on our hands. Good night.
===
Upon my soul, I think that fellow's the biggest blackguard I ever met.
I quite agree, old chap, but he is amusing.
===
ANOTHER EASTERN MELODY ON A FLUTE-LIKE INSTRUMENT SNEAKS IN BEHIND--
Oh, ho ho! Watson, you're incorrigible. But I think-- Watson?
===
What is it?
Look at the man sitting over in the corner by himself.
===
By Jove, yes. His - his face seems familiar. We've seen him before somewhere.
Of course we have. His name is Oliver Leaming. We met him at the inquest on the Montrevor case. 
===
So we did. Now, what on earth do you suppose he's doing here in the Casbah?
Not on a holiday, I'm sure. Mr. Oliver Leaming, if you recall, is a cousin of Douglas Milton's, the man we're searching for. If Milton were ever declared legally dead, Mr. Leaming over there would inherit the title. 
===
It looks to me as if we're not the only people in the Casbah who are searching for the missing heir.
That's true, old fellow. Come on, let's go and talk to the gentleman.
===
HOLMES AND WATSON RISE FROM THEIR CHAIRS AND WALK OVER TO LEAMING ... CROWD NOISE AND FLUTE-LIKE INSTRUMENT FILL THE PAUSE
Mr. Oliver Leaming! How very odd to meet you here!
===
Well, well! Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson! Won't you sit down?
Thank you.
===
Of course! But you seemed to be in such deep conversation with that scoundrel Rafi, I didn't like to disturb you.
Very considerate of you, I'm sure. Why are you here, Mr. Leaming?
===
Oh --- I'm making a business trip. This is my day off.
As I recall it, you're in the publishing business.
===
Correct. What a memory you have, Mr. Holmes.
It seems peculiar that you should be on a business trip here. Are you planning on opening a publishing house in Algiers? Or are you searching the Casbah for new authors?
===
Why not? I'm a great believer in encouraging new talent.
Mr. Leaming, why don't you admit that you're here for the express purpose of trying to find your cousin Douglas Milton?
===
Mr. Holmes, you've discovered my secret. The great Sherlock Holmes and his watchdog have their eagle eyes on me. They know that I succeed to the title if Douglas Milton dies.
Yes, Mr. Leaming, we know that fact.
===
Hm! What an extraordinary fellow. He's joking, of course.
I believe not, Watson. I think he labors under the whimsical belief that the best method of discounting the truth is to state it baldly so that it will not be believed.
===
Great Scott, then we must work fast.
Yes, old chap, we must. I am sure that we're entrants in a race against death. We must get back to the hotel and into our disguises as quickly as possible. After that, we shall visit a young lady named Ayisha in the Café of a Thousand Sighs. And I am certain, Watson, that it will be the first time two men have ever entered the Casbah for the express purpose of preventing a murder!
===
Yes, Mr. Bartell. Holmes quickly adopted the disguise of an Arab guide while I assumed the role of a tourist, and we started off on our search. Outside the Café of a Thousand Sighs, we met with a rude shock. Good lord! It's the fellow we met in the café.
Yes, Oliver Leaming -- with a knife between his shoulders. 
===
He's dead, Holmes. Shouldn't we get in touch with the police?
What can they do? Remember, there is no law in the Casbah. In any case, this man is beyond our help. Our job is to protect the living. Come on, old fellow, let's go to the Café of a Thousand Sighs and find this girl, Ayisha -- the girl Rafi says sings like a nightingale.
===
Oh, so - so that's the girl Ayisha. She - she's very beautiful.
Don't forget our role of tourist and guide, old chap. Master? Would wish to meet this Ayisha?
===
Oh, very much indeed.
I will see if it can be arranged, master. Wait here for me, Watson. I'll see what I can do.
===
CAFÉ PIANO FILLS THE PAUSE ... THEN IN BG
Mademoiselle Ayisha?
===
What do you want, greasy one?
There is an Englishman at the table over there. He wishes to talk to Ayisha.
===
Which one is he?
The man who sits at the table in the corner. He is very rich, Ayisha, and he admires you a great deal. He told me to give you this five-hundred-franc note.
===
So? Wery well. You may bring him to my rooms. The door is at top of stairway, to the right.
Good, Ayisha. I fetch him.
===
CAFÉ PIANO FILLS THE PAUSE ... THEN IN BG, OUT BY [X]
Ayisha will see you, master. Follow me, please.
===
I hope you know how you're going to handle this, Holmes.
Don't worry, Watson. In this case, I think honesty will be the best policy.
===
Well, I'm not so sure. This place is a thieves' kitchen, if ever I saw one. You'd better be careful.
First door to the right at the top of the stairs. This is it. [X]
===
DOOR SHUTS
Mademoiselle, I, uh, may as well tell you at once that I am not an Arab guide. My name is Sherlock Holmes.
===
What do you want with me? Why you trick your way in here?
Don't be frightened, Mademoiselle. I can explain our mission in a very few words. My friend and I have come in search of an Englishman by the name of Douglas Milton. We have good news for him. 
===
What make you think I might know of him?
A gentleman by the name of Rafi suggested that you might.
===
What is your good news for this Englishman?
That he has been cleared of suspicion of murder and that he is the rightful Earl of Montrevor.
===
Douglas Milton! We've found you at last!
It gives me infinite pleasure to have succeeded in my mission. How do you do, sir?
===
Oh, I think - a glass of port would be very nice, sir.
Yes, it would be most appropriate for toasting the new Earl of Montrevor.
===
Yes, yes, yes, we know that, my boy. In fact, that's how we first got onto your trail.
I shouldn't let that fact worry you, Mr. Milton. I'm certain the British consul in Algiers can arrange to have any charges dropped against a peer of the realm.
===
Why should I drink if you are leaving me?
Mr. Milton, do you know Oliver Leaming?
===
Well, yes. Yes, I did. If we weren't in the Casbah, I wouldn't tell you this, but-- Ayisha stabbed him. She followed him when he left here, killed him, and then slipped back just in time to sing her song a few moments ago. Oh, you needn't look so shocked, Dr. Watson. Life is cheap in the Casbah and Ayisha is a girl of violent passions. Come on, let's - let's drink.
A toast to the new Earl of Montrevor.
===
Oh, silly mistake; I can't bear port. Very un-English of me, I'm afraid, but-- Well, after all these years, I don't feel particularly English. In fact, I'll probably find it very hard to adjust myself to the old life when I go back. Or perhaps I should say if I go back.
Since you feel that way about it, Mr. Milton, why go? You can claim the title and the revenues of the estate without leaving Algeria. You could stay here and live on the income. 
===
I didn't realize that would be possible. Are you sure I could do that?
Oh, yes, I'm quite certain of it.
===
Poor Ayisha.
It's a bloody path that leads to the Montrevor title, sir. I suggest that we see that this poor girl's body is taken care of. And then go to the British consulate without any further delay.
===
ORGAN ... BRIDGE
Now that we're at the consulate, Mr. Milton, I suggest that you swear on oath that you are Douglas Milton, heir to the Montrevor estate -- this gentleman is a commissioner of oaths -- then we can go in and see the consul.
===
Thank you, sir. And now if you gentlemen will sign.
Yes, certainly.
===
Splendid. Let's go over and see the consul.
Not yet, my friend. Watson, this man is not Douglas Milton.
===
What the devil are you talking about?
There is no law in the Casbah, sir, so you cannot be punished for the two murders you committed there. But now that your avarice has tempted you here to Algiers where you've been foolish enough to sign a false statement, I think we can at least settle you very nicely for desertion, false impersonation, forgery and perjury.
===
Holmes, what do you mean?
The story should be obvious, old fellow. Oliver Leaming did track down the deserter. Recognition was uncertain after so many years, but at least it gave this gentleman the idea of impersonating the real Douglas Milton, a friend of his.
===
You have a lively imagination, Mr. Holmes.
The real Douglas Milton died of dysentery two years ago in Sidi Rached. As soon as the idea of impersonating Milton was born, Leaming had to die. 
===
Your theories are very interesting, but you haven't a shred of proof. I say that I'm Douglas Milton. How are you going to prove otherwise?
Very simply, my dear sir. Douglas Milton was a painter -- a painter who excelled in the use of vivid colors. You, sir, suffer from the quite common malady of red-green color blindness. Less than an hour ago, you mistook a glass of port, which is red, for a glass of crème de menthe, which is green. I knew at once that you were an impostor.
===
Here, here! Come back!
No, no, Watson. Don't go after him.
===
But we can't let him escape, Holmes!
Don't worry, old chap, he won't escape. I sent a message to Colonel de Brisson. If you go to the window, I think you'll find that the consulate is being watched.
===
FOOTSTEPS TO WINDOW
The Legion has a long memory for desertion. I don't think he'll get very far.
===
They got him, Holmes! Shot him as he was trying to run away!
A just death for him. He lived a life of violence and treachery, Watson. It's only fitting that he should die in the same manner.
===
Of course I couldn't. As I stood outside the well-remembered door, I looked up at the lighted windows and saw the tall, spare figure of my old friend pass twice in dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk on his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. He was hot on the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and a few moments later, found myself standing before him.
Marriage suits you, Watson. You look in splendid shape.
===
Yes, Holmes, I'm feeling very well, thanks.
And in practice again, I see. You didn't tell me that you'd gone back into harness.
===
Oh? How do you know?
Elementary, my dear chap. If a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver on his right forefinger and a bulge on the left side of his hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I should be dull, indeed, if I didn't pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.
===
Same as ever, Holmes. By the way, I'm, uh-- I'm not interrupting you, am I?
Yes, you are, old fellow, but it's a most welcome interruption.
===
You're working on a new case?
It looks like it. This letter arrived by the last post today. It's undated, and has neither signature nor address. Read it.
===
Let's have a look. "There will call upon you tonight, at a quarter to eight o'clock, a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted. This account of you we have from all quarters received." Hm! "Be in your chamber, then, at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wears a mask." Great Scott, it all sounds very mysterious. What do you imagine it means?
Look carefully at the note, Watson. What do you deduce from it?
===
Oh, let's see. Well, the man who wrote it was presumably well-to-do. Such paper couldn't be bought for under half a crown a packet. And it's peculiarly strong and stiff.
Peculiar -- that's the very word. It's not an English paper at all. Hold it up to the light. You notice anything?
===
Yes. There's a large "E" with a small "g"--
Mm hm.
===
--and a large "G" with a small "t" woven into the texture of the paper.
What does that suggest to you?
===
The name of the maker, no doubt; or perhaps his monogram.
Not at all, my dear fellow. The "G" with the small "t" stands for "Gesellschaft," which is the German for "Company."
===
And the "E - g"? 
That stands for Egria. 
===
Egria?
It's in a German-speaking country in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. 
===
So the paper was made in Bohemia. 
Undoubtedly. And the man who wrote the note is a German.
===
How do you know that?
Observe the curious construction of the sentence, "This account of you we have from all quarters received." A Frenchman or a Russian could not have written that. It's the German who is so discourteous to his verbs.
===
There's your client now. I'd better go, Holmes. 
No, no, no, no -- unless you have to. 
===
Well, I could stay; I thought perhaps that--
Then, my dear chap, stay. by all means. I'm lost without my Boswell, and this promises to be interesting. I told Mrs. Hudson to let the masked visitor come upstairs unannounced.
===
You, uh-- You received my note?
Yes, indeed. Come in, won't you, and sit down? 
===
You must excuse this mask that I wear. The august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is not exactly my own.
I was well aware of that fact, sir. 
===
You see, Mr. Holmes, the matter I am about to discuss implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia.
That had not escaped me either, sir. In fact, if you will state your case, I shall be better able to advise you -- your Majesty.
===
How--? How did you--? Yes. Yes, I am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?
Why, indeed?
===
I shall remove the mask. There. Mr. Holmes, I have traveled incognito from Prague for the express purpose of consulting you.
Then, pray consult. 
===
Irene Adler? We know of her, your Majesty.
Look her up in the index for me, will you, Watson? It's right beside you on the desk there.
===
Here we are, here we are. "A. Abrahams, Actongreen , Adler--" Adler.
Splendid. Hand me the file, old chap. Thank you. Mm hm! "Irene Adler. Born in New Jersey in the United States of America in Eighteen Fifty-Eight. Contralto." Mm hm. "Prima donna, Imperial Opera of Warsaw." Oh. "Retired from operatic stage. Living in London." Quite so. And here's a recent notation -- uh huh. Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person, wrote her some compromising letters and is now desirous of getting those letters back.
===
Precisely so. But how could--?
Was there a secret marriage?
===
None.
No legal papers or certificates?
===
Er, no.
Then I fail to follow, your Majesty. If this young lady should produce her letters for blackmailing purposes, how is she to prove their authenticity?
===
But it was private note-paper.
Stolen.
===
My own seal.
Imitated.
===
My photograph.
Bought.
===
But - we were both in the photograph.
Oh, dear me. Yes, that's very bad. Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion.
===
Mr. Holmes, it must be recovered. 
Perhaps if you were to pay enough, the photograph might be bought. 
===
She refuses to sell. 
Stolen, then.
===
Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house. Once we diverted her luggage when she traveled. Twice she has been waylaid. There has been no result.
Oh, dear, it's quite a pretty little problem. 
===
To ruin me. 
How, sir?
===
Well, I am about to be married to the second daughter of the King of Scandinavia. She is the [very] soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end.
And Irene Adler threatens to send the photograph to your fiancée, I suppose? 
===
I am sure.
And why?
===
She said she would send it on the day my betrothal is publicly announced. That day will be next Monday.
Splendid! Then we still have three days. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the present?
===
Yes, certainly. You will find me at the Langham Hotel, registered as Count Von Kramm.
Just two questions before you leave. 
===
What are they? 
Is the photograph large or small? 
===
Quite large. And it was in a heavy frame.
I see. And what is Irene Adler's London address, please?
===
Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John's Wood.
Thank you, your Majesty. Good night, and I trust that we shall soon have some good news for you.
===
Fascinating problem, Holmes. I wish I could help you with it. 
You can, my dear chap. I shall be glad of your company. 
===
What's our first move, Holmes? 
A good night's rest. We'll meet here at ten o'clock tomorrow morning. 
===
And then?
Then, my dear fellow, we will see what we can find out about Miss Irene Adler, late of the Warsaw Imperial Opera Company and at present residing at Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John's Wood.
===
Well, Holmes, I guess the examination of Briony Lodge didn't prove very illuminating.
No. A bijou residence that represents the essence of dignified suburbia, but tells us very little about the owner. I think a visit to the local public house might prove more instructive. Come on, old chap. I see the door of the Coach and Horse is inviting us from across the road.
===
Well, our disguises shouldn't cause any suspicion.
[That's why] I suggested them. In the character of a couple of stable hands, I felt that we might inspire confidence. This is a horsy neighborhood, and there's a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among their fraternity. Here we are. Better let me do most of the talking.
===
Yes, I will. I'm sure that your accent will be more convincing than mine.
Let's go in, shall we? 
===
Well, what'll it be, mateys? 
'Alf a bowl of malt, please. 'Ow 'bout you, Charley?
===
Here we are, mateys. Here. That'll be a tenner.
Have a drink wiv us, governor?
===
Don't mind if I do. I'll have a Guinness. You blokes new around here?
Oh, yes. We just come over from Clapham.
===
Clapham, eh? Well, here's looking at you. You hunting for jobs?
Yes, that's right. We was told that Miss Adler across at Briony Lodge needed a new coachman and groom.
===
Well, it's the first I've heard of it -- but it might be true. Have you been over there to ask?
No, not yet. We thought we'd find out something about the old girl first.
===
Yeah, of course I know her. Used to drive her carriage, I did, afore I come to work here. 
Oh. What's she like?
===
No. No, no. She lives quiet, like. Goes out singing at concerts once in a while. Rest of the time, it's money for gin. She goes out for a drive in the park every day at five and comes back to dinner at six-thirty. Rest of the time's your own.
Oh, she ain't married, you say?
===
No, no. But she's got a bloke what comes to see her all the time. He's a barrister; nice gentleman. Mr. Geoffrey Norton is his name. Good looking fella; wouldn't be surprised to see 'em get spliced.
Sounds like a nice, cushy job to me. Come on, Charley, let's get over to the house and see what's what. Much obliged to you, chum.
===
What's our next move, Holmes?
Let's stroll back to Briony Lodge, shall we? I'm undecided whether to continue my investigations there or to try and find out something about Mr. Geoffrey Norton, the barrister. If he is just her lawyer and nothing else, it's more than likely that she's entrusted the photograph to his safekeeping.
===
Hello, there's a cab waiting outside Miss Adler's house. 
Hurry, Watson. It may be Mr. Norton's.
===
Here we are at the gate.
Yes! And here comes a man hurrying down the pathway. Quick -- behind this post. Listen!
===
Here comes one! No, no, it isn't. It's a private carriage.
Miss Adler's, no doubt! Here she comes down the pathway. Back again behind the post, Watson!
===
Have you blokes got enough money to take a cab?
Here's half a sovereign for you, my man!
===
Right you are! Where to, governor?
The Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road, and another half sovereign for you if you get us there in twenty minutes!
===
Yes, Mr. Bartell, we did, but the other carriages were there before us. Holmes went into the church after telling me to guard the outside. I must have waited for ten minutes or more before Mr. Geoffrey Norton and Miss Adler came out, spoke a few words to each other and then left -- then and there, in their separate conveyances. A moment later, Holmes -- still dressed as a stable hand -- came striding out of the church and down the steps towards me. He was obviously very excited.
Watson! Watson, have they left?
===
Yes, in separate cabs. I overheard him say that he was going back to his office. And she said, "I shall drive out in the park at five o'clock, as usual." 
Splendid. Then come on -- we can return to Baker Street. 
===
What happened inside the church, Holmes? 
They were married.
===
Married?! 
Of course. The ceremony would have been illegal if performed after noon. That accounted for their wild dash to the church. Jump into the cab, old fellow. 
===
Where to now, governor?
Two Twenty-One B, Baker Street.
===
Oh, so they got married, eh? 
Yes. And it may amuse you to know that I acted as witness at the ceremony. 
===
You did? But how did that happen?
Their own witness had failed to appear and I was dragged into the breach. The bride gave me this sovereign as a memento. I, uh, think I'll wear it on my watch-chain in memory of the occasion.
===
What an amazing situation. Things begin to look better for the king, don't they? Now that she's Mrs. Norton, the chances are that she won't want to expose his Majesty, after all.
I hope so, Watson, I hope so. But we can't afford to take any chances. I think the time is ripe for us to come to closer grips with the lady!
===
Well, Holmes, now that we've eaten, perhaps you'll tell me your plan.
With pleasure, my dear fellow -- and while I'm so doing, I'll proceed with applying the makeup for my new disguise.
===
Another disguise? What's it to be this time?
I think the character and appearance of an amiable, simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman would be the most suited to my plan for entering Miss Adler's house.
===
You're going to try and enter, then? 
I must, my dear fellow. I'm sure the photograph is there. Miss Adler -- or, rather, Mrs. Norton -- will return from her drive in the park at six-thirty. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her.
===
And what then?
You must leave that to me. I've already made my arrangements. There is only one point on which I must insist -- you must not interfere, come what may. You understand?
===
I'm to remain neutral?
Yes. There will be some small unpleasantness. Don't join in. It will end in my being conveyed into the house. As soon as I am able to, I shall open one of the windows. You are to watch from outside. When I raise my hand, you will throw an object -- that I shall give you -- through the window and, at the same time, cry "Fire!" You follow me?
===
Entirely. But what am I to throw? 
Oh, it's nothing very formidable. Here it is. 
===
Huh. Looks like a great big cigar. What is it?
An ordinary plumber's smoke-rocket, fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your task is confined to throwing it through the window. When you raise the cry of fire, it will be taken up by quite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of the street, and I'll rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope I've made myself clear.
===
Perfectly. 
Good. And now, old fellow, as soon as I've donned my clerical attire, let's be on our way. There's no time to be lost.
===
It's nearly six-thirty, Holmes. We've been pacing up and down in front of her house for half an hour now. I hope she does come back.
I'm sure she will.
===
There seem to be a lot of loafers hanging around her gate.
All part of my conspiracy, old chap. You'll see them play their parts in a few minutes.
===
You still think the photograph is inside the house?
Yes. It's most unlikely that she carries it about with her. Remember, the king told us it was a large, framed picture. And also remember that she planned to use it within a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands on it. It must be inside her house.
===
But her house has been burgled. Twice. 
Oh, psh! They didn't know how to look.
===
How will you look? 
I won't. I'll get her to show me. 
===
Oh, she'll refuse.
She won't be able to-- 
===
Please, please, don't fight about it!
I'll - I'll tell you what-- Stop molesting the lady, please!
===
Holmes -- there you are! You - you have the photograph? 
No, but I know where it is. She showed me, as I told you she would. 
===
Well, I'm still in the dark.
There's no mystery, old chap. When my accomplices started the row in the street, I had a little moist red paint in my hand. My good friend Alfie pretended to strike me; I clapped my hand to my head and fell down. It's an old trick.
===
Yes, I understand that, but how did my throwing the rocket help you?
It was all-important, my dear fellow. When a woman thinks her house is on fire, her instinct is at once to rush for the thing that she values most. A married woman grabs her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. In this case, of course, it was the photograph.
===
Where was it?
In a recess in the living room, just above the right-hand bell-pull. I caught a glimpse of it as she drew it out. When I made it known that the fire was a false alarm, she replaced the photograph. As soon as I was able to, I advised her that I was feeling well enough to leave.
===
You didn't take the photograph, then.
No, I felt that over-precipitance at this stage might ruin everything.
===
What do we do now? 
Drive to the Langham Hotel and inform his Majesty of what has happened. Then return with him here. And after that, my dear chap, the case will be ended!
===
I am all impatience. You are certain the photograph will still be there, Mr. Holmes?
I have every reason to believe so, your Majesty.
===
I must confess, this is going to be something of an ordeal.
Then I suggest that you let me do the talking, your Majesty. I think I know how to handle the lady.
===
Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?
Yes. I am Mr. Holmes. But - how did you know?
===
Then the papers -- and the photograph? Oh, all is lost!
We'll soon see. Follow me. 
===
She said you'd be looking for something. I hope you find it!
This was the bell-rope. Sliding panel behind it. 
===
Is - is the photograph there, Mr. Holmes?
There is a photograph, your Majesty. But it's, um, a photograph of the lady alone. Here's a letter -- and it's addressed to me.
===
What does it say, Holmes?
"My dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes. You really did it very well. Until after the fire alarm, I had no suspicion. But then, when I realized how I had betrayed myself, I began to think. I had been warned that if the King employed an agent he would certainly employ you. May I congratulate you on your disguise as a dear, old clergyman."
===
Ja, ja, go on. What else does it say?
"My husband and I both thought that the best recourse was flight, so you will find the nest empty. As to the photograph of the King and myself, his Majesty may rest in peace." Oh, thank goodness for that. "I love and am loved by a better man than he. I leave another photograph, however, that he might care to possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes, very truly yours, Irene Norton, née Adler." What a woman, Watson; what a woman; what a magnificent woman! She fooled me completely! But-- Oh. I, uh-- I'm sorry, your Majesty, I - I've been unable to bring your business to a more successful conclusion.
===
I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward you. Uh, this - this beryl ring that I wear. I - I should be proud to--
Your Majesty has something that I should value even more highly.
===
You have but to name it.
This photograph, sir.
===
Irene's photograph? But certainly. However, you must let me give you something more substantial.
Oh no, no, no, your Majesty. This is something I shall treasure all my life. This and a golden sovereign I received from the lady's hand. They will remind me that I was once tricked by a woman! A woman that I shall never forget.
===
Well, Dr. Watson, you make a grand Santa Claus.
Doesn't he, Mrs. Hudson? Try the beard on, Watson old chap.
===
Oh, you look just like the old man on the Christmas cards, doctor.
Yes, Watson, it really becomes you. The cheery twinkle of the eyes, the ruddy complexion, and the, er-- The appropriate girth. What a shame we can't obtain some snow, and a sleigh and reindeer, for you. However, I'm sure Mrs. Hudson's nieces will be very much impressed.
===
Holmes, what are you going to do with yourself? I hate leaving you alone on Christmas Eve.
Oh, don't worry, old chap. I shall spend a profitable evening writing on my new monograph.
===
Oh? What's this one about?
An analysis of teeth marks on pipe stems, with particular regard to indicated character.
===
Oh, gracious me, how exciting. Well! I must be going!
Don't forget your sack of presents, old fellow.
===
Oh, great Scott, no, no, no.
Ah, when you come to distribute them, you'll find that I took the liberty of adding a few trinkets on my own behalf.
===
Oh, excuse me, Mr. Holmes, but there's a gentleman to see you. Says he's an old friend of yours. Here's his card, sir.
Oh, thank you. Oh! It's old Widecombe! Splendid! Ask him to come up please, Mrs. Hudson.
===
All right, sir.
And I hope your party is a great success, Mrs. Hudson.
===
Thank you, sir. Are you sure you don't want me to stay? Now that you have a visitor, I mean.
Oh, no, no, no; indeed, no, Mrs. Hudson. I can show the gentlemen out myself. You go off and have a good time.
===
I wonder what Lord William wants. Perhaps I should stay and give you--
No, no, please, my dear fellow; certainly not.
===
Eh?
You've far more important work to do. Widecombe probably wants his revenge at chess or something equally innocuous. Off with you, my dear fellow, and enjoy yourself.
===
Oh, very good. Just the same, I wish you were coming with me. I'll see you later.
I shall be there. Uh, come on up, Widecombe!
===
How are you, Holmes? All alone on Christmas Eve, eh?
Yes, Widecombe. I'm glad you came over to see me.
===
Mm hm.
What's it to be? An evening of chess? Or have you unearthed some recent treasure of medieval pottery that we can discuss?
===
Neither, Holmes. I've come to you in your professional capacity. I - I need help.
Oh, come now, Widecombe. Don't tell me that after all these years of quiet friendship, you're going to become a client.
===
Yes, I'm afraid so, Holmes, though I doubt if my problem will interest you very much. It's hardly up to your rather colorful standards. Er, care for a cigar?
Oh, thanks.
===
Well, I decided this year to have a little Christmas party at my town house. I'm quite comfortably off, as you know, and it occurred to me that I have several relatives and friends who are not as well off. I'm having a party for them tonight, Holmes, and I hoped you'd attend it -- disguised as Santa Claus.
Oh, my dear fellow, I've adopted many disguises in my time, but Father Christmas has never been one of them. Why do you want me to attend your party in disguise in any case? Are you ashamed of your friendship with a private detective or do you consider my features more acceptable when buried beneath the depths of a snowy beard?
===
Now, my dear Holmes, do take me seriously. I'm not joking, I assure you.
Oh, of course you're not, of course you're not. You, uh-- You want me to attend your party in disguise. Why?
===
I'm giving some very valuable presents -- er, diamond and onyx cufflinks, platinum and ruby earrings, and suchlike -- and I've wrapped each of the presents in bank notes.
Dear me. Where are these presents now?
===
In a sack, in charge of my butler. I was going to dress up as Santa Claus and give 'em out meself, until I got the warning letter. That's why I've come to you.
Warning letter, eh?
===
Yes. I received it by this evening's post. Listen to this. "My dear Lord Widecombe, Your generosity with Christmas presents borders on ostentation. We do not approve. Either we receive five thousand pounds in sovereigns at Poste Restante Box Three-Seven-Nine by six o'clock on Christmas Eve or I'm afraid your Christmas party will be conspicuous by its absence of presents."
Let me see that note, Widecombe, will you?
===
I'm delighted, Holmes. But what made you decide so suddenly?
This writing, my dear fellow, this writing. Though it's in a false hand, I'd know that characteristic "M" in "My dear Widecombe." I've seen it too often at the beginning of a signature. Moriarty!
===
Moriarty? Who's he?
Oh, one of the cleverest and most unscrupulous criminals in England. Widecombe, there's no time to be lost. It's -- let me see now -- six-thirty, half an hour beyond the deadline given you in this letter. We must go to your house at once.
===
This is my house, Holmes. Number Thirty-Nine.
Thirty-Nine Bronson Square, eh? And dear old Watson is just around the corner in Lexington Gardens and hasn't any idea that I've left Baker Street.
===
Most of them, sir. They're in the library. You brought another Santa Claus with you, I see, milord.
Another Santa Claus? What do you mean?
===
The gentleman arrived three quarters of an hour ago, sir, dressed as Santa Claus. I took him to your study, milord, and showed him the sack of presents.
Confound it! He's got here before us! Where's the study?
===
But he can't have left the house, milord. I've been watching the front door.
Yes, and while you were doing that, he slipped out through the window here. The catch is undone.
===
I can't tell you much about his appearance, I'm afraid, sir. He was dressed as Santa Claus, just like yourself. But I did notice one thing about him, sir.
Oh? What was that?
===
He lisped, sir. It was quite pronounced.
Of course! Lou the Lisper!
===
Who on earth is Lou the Lisper?
One of Moriarty's most trusted accomplices. Fortunately, though, I've had news of him lately through my underworld grapevine.
===
You, er-- You know where he lives?
He's reputed to have some connections with a new cult that calls themselves the Disciples of the Octagonal Square. Their headquarters are just around the corner from here.
===
Then let's go there at once.
Of course. And, Hargrave--?
===
Yes, sir?
Get a message to Scotland Yard as fast as you can. Ask for Inspector Lestrade, and tell him to join me at the Temple of the Octagonal Square in Lexington Gardens as soon as possible.
===
Where are you, Holmes?
Here by the bed. This is the only room in the temple that gives any signs of having been lived in. I think our bird has been here, but I'm afraid he's flown. Wish Inspector Lestrade would get here. Strike a match, will you, Widecombe?
===
Ah, here's a candle on the table.
Ah, just as I feared! Look on the bed.
===
A red coat, and a beard.
Yes. Lou the Lisper has discarded his disguise and gone -- and with him, I'm afraid, your valuable presents.
===
Oh, wait a minute! Here's a sack lying on the floor-- Oh, no, this isn't mine. Look what's in it. A toy dog -- large box of chocolates -- little girl's doll.
What in thunder--? Why, this is Watson's sack!
===
But how on earth could Lou the Lisper have got hold of it?
Somewhere, somehow, he and Watson must have made an accidental change and Lou the Lisper is no doubt trying to track Watson down at this very moment. We must work fast, Widecombe -- or my friend's life, and those of Mrs. Hudson and her relatives, won't be worth a tinker's dam!
===
Yes. Seems to me, Lord Widecombe, you'd've been wiser to get in touch with Scotland Yard when you first got the warning note. We could have nabbed him when he came to your house and pinched the sack of presents.
Lestrade, this is no time for post mortems. We've got to reach Lou the Lisper before he finds Dr. Watson.
===
Do you suppose he can do that, Holmes?
It wouldn't be difficult. Lou the Lisper is nearly as clever as his master, Professor Moriarty. The chances are that you were followed when you came to Baker Street tonight, Widecombe. And it's equally likely that Watson and Mrs. Hudson were followed as they left it. Moriarty seldom leaves anything to chance.
===
Well, where did Dr. Watson go tonight?
Twenty-Eight Lexington Gardens. It's just around the corner from here.
===
Well, then let's go there at once.
And frighten our quarry away? No, no, no, no, Lestrade. We must use a little subtlety. Now, Lou the Lisper wishes to recover that sack of presents from Watson. How would he invade the party with the least possible trouble?
===
By, er-- By dressing up as Santa Claus again?
No. No, I think he's overplayed that role for one evening.
===
Well, then how would he try to get in, Mr. Holmes?
Oh, come now, Lestrade. What group of people can enter any house on Christmas Eve without invitation and without creating suspicion?
===
The carol singers!
Exactly, my dear fellow! I shouldn't be at all surprised if at this very moment Lou the Lisper and some of his gang are singing carols outside Twenty-Eight Lexington Gardens.
===
Well, then what are we going to do?
Form a rival choral society. How many of your men did you bring with you?
===
Three, a sergeant and two constables.
Wearing greatcoats?
===
Yes, Mr. Holmes, but why?
Good. They can hide their helmets and pretend to be singers. Come on. Let's go over there and, while we're walking, we'll rehearse our carols. We must appear reasonably convincing. Sound your A, Lestrade, sound your A!
===
Are we going in now?
In a moment. Now, men -- you have your truncheons handy?
===
Yes, Mr. Holmes, we're ready.
Splendid. Now, remember -- when we're inside and I yell "Merry Christmas" at the top of my voice, you bring out your truncheons and get Lou the Lisper and his gang out of there as quickly as possible. Don't arrest them until you get them outside again, Lestrade; I don't want to frighten the children.
===
Well, all right. What - what do you want to thing?
How 'bout "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing," eh?
===
"Hark! The herald angels sing / Glory to the newborn king--"
Merrrrry Christmas!
===
Holmes! Holmes, what in thunder's going on?!
I'll explain it to you later, old chap. Lestrade?!
===
Yes, Mr. Holmes?
Take them to Scotland Yard and prefer charges. I'll be over in a little while and give evidence.
===
Right you are, sir. Too bad we didn't catch Professor Moriarty, too.
Well, at least we have some of his cohorts. I'll see you later, Lestrade.
===
I wish I knew what was going on here. Is Moriarty mixed up in this business?
Yes, Watson, and I'll tell you all about it as soon as I've straightened this thing out. Oh, Widecombe?
===
Yes, Holmes?
The twenty-pound notes that you used as wrapping for your gifts seem to have been scattered all over the house. Uh, do you want me to recover them, too?
===
No. From what you've told me of the children, I think their parents could use the money much more profitably than my relatives. In any case, I can replace it.
A very generous Christmas gift. Well, children -- did you enjoy the little game we staged for you?
===
I got these pretty earrings.
Oh, they were a part of the game, too! A nice little girl like you doesn't want silly earrings, Elsie. Here's a beautiful doll for you.
===
Coo! Her eyes open and shut and everything!
And what did you get, my little man?
===
These!
Oh, cufflinks! Good gracious, who wants cufflinks when he can have a - a clockwork train! You want to exchange?
===
Oh, coo! He's lovely!
And here you are, children. Here's a nice big box of chocolates, too. You can all share them.
===
I - I still don't understand what's going on, Holmes, but I - I must say, this has all the earmarks of being a happy Christmas.
Yes, old fellow. Mrs. Hudson?
===
Aye, Mr. Holmes?
How's the turkey coming along?
===
Oh, it'll be ready in a few minutes, Mr. Holmes.
Splendid. And, while we're waiting, perhaps the children will oblige with something we haven't heard so far this evening.
===
There must be a funeral in the village, Holmes.
An astonishing deduction, Watson.
===
There's no need to make fun of me. Impressing sound isn't it?
I suppose so. Has it ever occurred to you Watson that the history of bells is full of romantic interest?
===
Well, I can't say that I've thought much about it.
Almost every historical event has been accompanied by the sound of bells. They summon soldiers to arms, as well as Christians to church. They sounded the alarm in 5 ? 2 Multan invasion. And many a bloody chapter in history has been rung in and out by bells.
===
Well, you seem to be a mind of information on the subject.
Yes, Watson. It's a fascinating subject.
===
Poor little thing. I wonder what's the matter with her?
I have no idea.
===
Perhaps her father or mother just died. Or a young man, yes, I bet that's it. She's a pretty girl. She'd obviously been crying when she came in. Perhaps that's her fianc? they're burying now.
Watson, you have the sentimental imagination of the true storyteller. But we've come here for a holiday. You must give your imagination a rest, too. So, drink your tea, remove your whiskers, and we'll go downstairs and investigate those kippers.
===
Excellent, Mrs. Michol, excellent. Never eaten better.
Yes, indeed. By the way, Mrs. Michol, we heard the funeral bell tolling earlier on. Do you know who was being buried?
===
A murderer? Lord, in this peaceful village.
What happened, Mrs. Michol?
===
Old Threadgold the corn merchant found out his wife had been gallivanting around with a young fellow from Bolton. Cut her throat, he did, and then hanged himself. More tea?
Thank you. 
===
Shocking! So the peaceful countryside is not as peaceful as it's made out to be, Holmes.
Thank that I frequently had occasion to point out to you, Watson. Has the morning post arrived yet, Mrs. Michol?
===
A murder. What do you make of it, Holmes?
What is there to make of it, Watson? A jealous husband murders a faithfuless wife and then commits suicide. A tragic story, but a simple one.
===
Top of the morning to you, gentlemen.
Good morning, Gillian. Any letters for me today?
===
Bless your heart, Dr. Watson. If I didn't read other people's correspondence, how would I know what's going on in the village?
Hmm, you were right, Gilly, it is newspaper clippings. And by the way, you heard about the murder of Mrs. Threadgold, I suppose?
===
Bless your heart, yes, Doctor. President of the Choral Society, too, as well as being on the Perries council.
You're a busy man, Gillian.
===
Talkative ol' busybody he is. Oh, Mr. Holmes, Mrs. Lakland's in the hall. The poor old lady is most anxious to talk to you.
Mrs. Lakland?
===
I told her that Dr, but she won't go away without seeing Mr. Holmes.
Oh, very well. Ask her to come in, please, Mrs. Michol.
===
Oh, I do bother to see her, Holmes. Sounds like a trivial matter. 
The disappearance of an only son can never be a trivial matter.
===
Good morning.
Good morning. Please sit down, Mrs. Lakland. That's it. Now what's the trouble?
===
It's Tom, sir. Me only son. He left me four months ago and I've not seen heir a night of him since.
You've had no message from him since he left?
===
Not one word, I'm fair out of me mind, sir.
Have you any idea of his reason for leaving the village, Mrs. Lakland?
===
None, sir. He was a good boy and he worked hard, and he didn't fool around with those flibbity gibbit girls in the village. I think he's met with foul play gentlemen, and I want you to find out about him for me, Mr. Holmes. I've heard say in the village that you're the greatest detective in England.
Mrs. Lakland, I'd be glad to help you, but you've given me no clues to work with. I'm afraid that I . . .
===
If it's money you want I've got twenty pounds in me poster savings. It's all yours if you can bring my Tommy home to me. Or at least tell me he's safe.
Mrs. Lakland, I wouldn't dream of accepting a fee. However I shall give your problem some thought. If I arrive at any conclusions, I'll get in touch with you at once.
===
God bless you, Mr. Holmes. Good morning to you, sirs.
Good day.
===
Good morning, Mrs. Lakland. Poor old thing. I don't see how you can help her, Holmes.
Nor do I -- at the moment. But a young man who has grown up in a small village like this may have led a life that his mother is totally unaware of. You said that you have to work on one of your stories today, Watson.
===
Yes I have a letter from the editor of the Strand magazine yesterday requesting a manuscript as soon as possible.
Splendid! Then you must stay at the Inn and work on your latest masterpiece, while I scour the village to see what may be found out about the missing young man.
===
There you are, Holmes! I was beginning to think you got lost.
Hello, Watson. I trust you had a profitable session with pen and paper?
===
I got about half a chapter. I would have done more if it hadn't been for those infernal bells.
The wedding ceremony that the worthy Gillian told us about this morning. Oh, I'm tired.
===
What did you find out about Mrs. Lakland's son?
Among other things, that he had a secret love life unknown to his mother. And the object of his affections was none other than the maid who brought us our tea this morning.
===
Mary! Did you talk to her?
No it's her half-day off and I was unable to find her. But I shall question her when she brings our tea tomorrow morning.
===
DOOR OPENS
Come in, Mary. 
===
Good morning, gentlemen. Here's your tea and shaving water.
Where's Mary this morning?
===
She didn't come to work. Must be ill again. Not a reliable girl, and no better than she ought to be if you ask me. It's no job for me to be carrying tea and hot water upstairs. 
I hear the village bell tolling for another funeral. Does Conforth have a burial every morning? I really don't see how the population can run to it.
===
That woman seems absolutely heartless. She almost smacks her lips when she tells us about these tragedies.
Yes, Watson, I noticed it. This peaceful village is beginning to seem strangely sinister to me. And since you have no appetite for breakfast, perhaps you'll join me in a little excursion as soon as you're dressed.
===
Of course. Where're we going?
To see the maid, Mary. I'm anxious to talk to her before another funeral bell begins to toll.
===
This must be the cottage home. They said it was the one with honeysuckle over the gate.
Yes, and there's Mary sitting on the porch.
===
She's got up, she's coming up the path to meet us.
Good morning, Mary. I'm sorry you're not feeling well.
===
Oh, you misjudged us, my dear. I assure you that we . . .
No, Watson. Let's be honest and admit we didn't come here because of our concern for Mary's health. 
===
Then why did you come here, sir?
Mrs. Lakland asked me to try to find her son, Tom.
===
Tom?
Yes, Tom Lakland. I thought you might be able to help me, Marian.
===
Amazing deduction.
That sounds like your young friend from Daylis, Watson.
===
How did you know about??. I mean, I don't have a young friend from Daylis Watson.
Quite. Gilly, you tolled another funeral bell today, didn't you?
===
No. I'll never hear from Tom, now He's ashamed of me. That's why he deserted me.
Deserted you, Mary? You speak almost as if you were his wife.
===
We were married secretly in Rochdale five months ago come Tuesday.
And he never told his mother?
===
He was afraid to. She thought I was beneath him. Tom said he'd go away and get a good job and then return here and fetch me back with him. He went away all right. But he never came back or sent me a word.
When he left, did he give no clues to his destination? No hints of any kind, Mary?
===
Wait. He did once say "Mary, I'm gonna clear out to this puddle and make me fortune. Even if I have to bury it." And then he said, "Bury me fortune? Huh. That's a joke, isn't it?" I don't know what he meant by it.
I think I do, Mary. Watson, we're taking a short train journey as soon as possible.
===
Oh? Where are we going? May I ask?
We're going to the town of Berry, in search of this young lady's husband.
===
What makes you think Tom might be in Berry, Mr. Holmes?
Because the famous Fortune Cotton Mills are in Berry. It would seem possible that when your husband joked of burying his fortune, he was talking of going to the mills there.
===
How much longer is Holmes going to be? He leaves me standing outside the factory gates as if I were a blasted coachman. Ah there he is, there he is! Holmes! Holmes!
Hello, Watson. Permit me to introduce you to Mr. Tom Lakland. Tom, this is Dr. Watson.
===
You are? Oh no need to become aggressive.
No let's waste time on being acrimonious Watson. Let's get back to the station as fast as we can. The return of the prodigal is long overdue. We must give them every opportunity to kill the fatted calf.
===
Ah, there's Mary's house, I'm dying to see her.
And after this reunion, Tom, I suggest that you both go over and see your mother. I'm sure she'll forgive you. 
===
Great heavens, that was a revolver shot!
Come on Watson! Help me break in the door!
===
It will be, Tom, won't it? Oh, I'm so tired.
And now, Tom, I think the time has come to reassure Mary that you did write to her.
===
Then why didn't I get the letters?
The answer to that should be obvious my dear. Gilly the postman deliberately withheld them from you.
===
Great heavens! Why?
I have my suspicions. Strong suspicions. But I have to get proof. Tell me Mary, the day before yesterday, Mr. Threadgold murdered his wife. Do you know how he learned of her infidelity?
===
Gilly again.
Precisely! Surely the whole terrible pattern begins to take shape. Tom?
===
Yes, Mr. Holmes.
I'm going to lay a trap. To spring it I shall need your assistance.
===
Of course, Mr. Holmes, I'll do anything. 
Wait here with Mary until darkness falls. Then muffle yourselves up and go to your mother's house. Wait there in hiding and let no outsiders see you until you hear from me.
===
Since you two love birds have been separated for four months I don't imagine that will be too unpleasant.
Quiet, Watson. You understand, Tom?
===
Yes, Mr. Holmes.
Good. Come on, Watson.
===
What's your plan, Holmes?
I'll tell you as we go. One thing I can promise you. Before the sun is very high tomorrow I shall free this village from one of the most subtly evil powers I've ever come in contact with.
===
Good morning, Mrs. Michol.
Good morning.
===
That's very chaitable, Mrs. Michol, I must say, in any case the vicar says that the poor girl was of unsound mind.
Yes, madam, you can't blame her.
===
Holmes this farce is beginning to get on my nerves. What are we accomplishing by burying an empty coffin?
You'll soon see, old chap. Come on. Let's slip into the vestry. This way.
===
Where're we going, Homes?
Up the stairs that lead to the belfry. Here they are.
===
Well supposing Gilly turns nasty when he finds out we know his secret.
Then we must handle him to the best of our ability, Watson.
===
Well I must say I do not relish the thought of a tussle high in the belfry of a church. The man must be insane.
Obviously. That's why his power must be destroyed. This door apparently leads to the belfry. Keep your wits about you Watson.
===
Mr. Holmes, Dr. Watson. You've come to see me at work. That's nice of ya. Not often I get company up here. 
We haven't come up here to see you at work, Gilly. We know your diabolical work only too well.
===
What secret's that?
You're mad with power, Gilly. You've tried to control the destiny of this village. In your position as postman you thought you have the power to give life and death.
===
Aye sir. That I was, and for the old man hanging himself.
You were responsible for John Letterby's suicide weren't you?
===
That I was. Letterby tried to vote me off the village council. I swore I'd make him pay for it. And I did.
Your reign is over Gillian. You'll never toll a bell again. The only one you'll hear will be a prison bell.
===
You can't touch me, Mr. Holmes. You've got no proof. There's nothing you can do.
Don't be too sure. I have enough influence to take your job away.
===
You, you, You'd take me away from me bells? I live for these bells. You wouldn't take me away from them?
You couldn't live without the power they give you. Could you, Gilly?
===
You're trying to destroy me. 
You are already destroyed, Gilly.
===
A-Alive? But the coffin they're burying down there?
Is full of stone. You'll be the laughing stock of the village, Gilly.
===
He's running up the ladder leading to the bell tower.
Come back, Gilly, come back!
===
He's mad as a hatter.
Quite.
===
What's he going to do up there? He might set fire to the steeple. Could make any madness. I'm going to fetch him, Holmes.
No, Watson. He drew a knife as he fled. And with that rickety staircase and the narrow opening leading into the bell chamber you'd never stand a chance. He'd get you on the first ledge.
===
How're we going to get him down?
There's only one way. He's in a tiny loft containing his beloved bells. We'll see how much he loves them at close quarters. I doubt if even he can stand the noise in that confined space. Where's that bell rope?
===
Stop! Stop ringing me bell!
Not until you come down, Gilly.
===
Stop ringing them! I can't stand it. You'll make me mad.
You are mad, Gilly. Mad with power. Come down here I say.
===
Great Heavens, he hurled himself out of the belfry. Holmes, he hasn't the chance of surviving that fall.
I had no intention of causing that unhappy man to jump to his death, Watson. Though I can't help but feel that his poor, demented mind may find a happier oblivion this way rather than in the confines of an asylum.
===
Yes, you're probably right, Holmes.
It's been a shocking case, Watson. Shocking. And once again it proves the old saying that "violence does intrude recoil upon the violent." And, "the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another."
===
Christmas. Christmas in our London of the 1880s ... with the sparkle 'round the gaslights and the glow on the hurrying passersby laden with mysterious parcels ... with candled shop windows heaped with toys ... with tinkling hansoms hastening past ... with a million tall trees in a million tall drawing-rooms. Christmas. And in the glow and glory of it, I called at Baker Street to see my old friend Sherlock Holmes. Compliments of the season, Holmes!
Eh? Who? What? Who's that?
===
Compliments of the season, Holmes.
Oh, Watson, it's you. Good evening, how do you do?
===
Ah, I say that's a deuced cold greeting for the time of year. Or don't you believe in the Christmas spirit?
Yes, yes, of course I do, my dear fellow. It's only that I'm profoundly engaged. My mind was elsewhere. Er, close the door, Watson. Come in. There's a confounded din from the street.
===
Of course, if you're engaged, Holmes, I'd better not stay. I've still some visits to make to my patients.
No, no, no, no. Of course! You know how glad I always am to have you, old friend, to discuss my problems with. Now, help yourself to a whiskey and soda, Watson.
===
Oh, thank you.
And just tell me what you think of that.
===
Think of what?
That. Hanging on the back of the chair there. I've been contemplating it for the last half hour.
===
It's, er-- It's only a hat. Er, a simple hard black hat.
Just so.
===
Well, let me find the nutmeg grater first and I'm ready. Where--? Er, yes. Ah, here it is.
Well, then. You know Peterson, the commissionaire at the hotel on the corner?
===
But of course. Why? Is it his hat?
No, his trophy.
===
Huh? Trophy?
Well, he found it. The owner is unknown. It arrived here, Watson, in company with a fine fat goose, which I have no doubt at this moment is roasting merrily in front of the Petersons' fire.
===
Oh ho. Well! A goose and a hat. No doubt the connection's obvious, but, er-- But, er-- Where - where - where do you put the lemons, my dear fella?
Lemons? Oh, try the gasogene stand.
===
No.
Oh, well, then that hideous bamboo smoking companion that Mrs. Hudson will insist on setting down beside the sofa every afternoon.
===
Ah, yes! Here we are.
Well now, the facts are these, Watson: Peterson -- who is a very honest fellow, as you know -- was returning about four o'clock this morning from some small seasonal jollification and walking homewards down the Tottenham Court Road.
===
Oh, ah, stir the fire a bit, will you? My hands are full.
Certainly, Watson. Heh! Of course.
===
Uh-huh.
As he reached the corner of Warren Street, this man was suddenly set upon by a crowd of roughs. One of them knocked his hat off and as he raised his stick to defend himself, he accidentally swung it against a shop window and smashed the glass.
===
Oh ho! Well, what happened next, Holmes?
Well, Peterson, who was still wearing his commissionaire's uniform, rushed to the man's assistance. But the fellow, shocked at breaking a window and seeing a man in uniform running up to him, dropped his goose and took to his heels.
===
Huh.
The roughs did the same, leaving Peterson master of the field of battle. He brought both bird and hat to me. There was a card on the bird's leg with "For Mrs. Henry Baker" written on it and the initials "H. B." are written on the label inside the hat.
===
Ah ha.
But of course there are some thousands of people named Baker in this great city of ours, so it has been my little occupation for this last hour or so to try and deduce the exact identity of this one.
===
From his hat?
Yes, Watson. The owner of this hat, Watson-- --highly intellectual, fairly well-to-do, but in the space of the last three years seems to have fallen on evil days. He used to have foresight, but he has less now than formerly. I suspect he's taken to drink, which would also perhaps account for the fact that his wife no longer loves him.
===
Oh, my dear Holmes.
Middle-aged, goes out little, has grizzled hair -- which he anoints with lime-cream -- and has been to the barber's lately. It is also extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house.
===
Ah, come, Holmes. Now you're surely joking.
Not at all.
===
Now, I've seen you at this kind of thing before, of course, but this is going too far. His wife, Holmes--
Ah?
===
You said she'd stopped loving him.
The hat hasn't been brushed for weeks, my dear fellow.
===
What?
Well, when I see you, Watson, with such an accumulation of dust on your respectable headgear, I shall expect you to be returning to your old quarters here within the next day or two.
===
Oh, Holmes, Holmes -- you have an answer for everything. Wonderful, wonderful. Except the gas. The fact that there's no gas laid on in his house, now that really is impossible.
Not at all. One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance, but when I see no less than five, I think there can be little doubt that the owner must be brought in frequent contact with burning tallow. Yes, he probably walks upstairs at night with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other. Anyhow, he never got tallow stains from a gasjet. Satisfied?
===
Ha! 'Pon my soul, 'pon my soul, it's really, really most - most ingenious.
Elementary, my dear Watson.
===
Well, actually, it seems rather a waste of your talents, for there's been no crime committed. Nothing but the loss of a Christmas goose.
That goose, my dear fellow--
===
Mr. Holmes, sir, are you in?
Hello, hello, what's this? Who is it? Yes? Come in!
===
Mr. Holmes?
My dear Peterson!
===
Oh-- It's - it's the goose, sir.
Well, has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window? You're as white as a sheet.
===
Oh, well-- See here, sir. Here. Look what my wife found inside its crop.
Watson! Look.
===
This - this is a treasure trove indeed, Peterson. Yes, a precious stone. One of the biggest I've ever seen.
It's more than a precious stone, Watson. It's the precious stone. The blue carbuncle.
===
Great heavens! The - the Countess of Morcar's?
Precisely. Missing for five days and with a descriptive advertisement every morning in The Times about it. And a reward of a thousand pounds for its recovery.
===
Yes, yes, I remember now. Lost at the Hotel Cosmopolitan.
That's it, and they've arrested some plumber fellow who's supposed to have taken it from the countess's jewel case.
===
I was reading about it only just now. Yes. Here we are, here we are. "The Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, plumber, twenty-six, was brought up on the charge of having abstracted from the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle."
What else, Watson?
===
Well, it seems that this fellow Horner was taken up to the countess's room by her maid -- a girl called Catherine Cusack -- to do some kind of repair.
Hmm.
===
When the head attendant of the hotel went in -- a fellow called James Ryder -- to see if the work was finished, he found the jewel case was lying empty and that Horner had gone. Then he gave the alarm and Horner was found by the police and they arrested him. The case has been referred to the Assizes.
Hmm. Well, then the only problem remaining to be solved is the sequence of events leading from an empty jewel-case in a hotel room at one end, to the crop of a goose in the Tottenham Court Road at the other. Er, just give me a pencil and that slip of paper, will you, Peterson?
===
What are you going to do, Holmes?
Find the owner of this hat. "H. B., Henry Baker." Yes, he began as a joke and now he's become a mystery. We'll try the simplest method first -- an advertisement. How's this, Watson? Read it.
===
"Found at the corner of [Tottenham Court Road and] Warren Street: a goose and a black felt hat. Mr. Henry Baker can have the same by applying at six-thirty this evening at Two-Two-One Baker Street."
Clear and concise, I think. Yes, if you've quite recovered from your astonishment, Peterson--
===
Sir?
Just run down to the advertisement office and have this put in all the evening papers, will you?
===
All of them, sir?
All of them. Oh, and by the way, Peterson--?
===
Sir?
On your way back, just see if you can buy another goose.
===
Another goose, sir?
Yes, as near as possible the same size as that one that your family is about to devour.
===
Oh. Oh! Oh, yes, sir. Um, you're going to keep the stone, sir?
Yes, here in my strong-box. And I'll just drop a note to the Countess to say we found it. Hurry up, Peterson.
===
BRIDGE
Ah, Mr. Henry Baker, if I am not mistaken. Do come in, Mr. Baker.
===
Oh, thank you, sir.
Sit down, won't you? Pray, sit down.
===
Thank you.
This is my good friend, Dr. Watson.
===
How do you do?
Mayn't I help you to a whiskey and soda, Mr. Baker?
===
Oh - oh - oh, thank you. I'll, er-- I'll leave out the soda if I may, Mr. Holmes.
Oh, of course.
===
Oh, nothing, sir. Forgive us; a private matter.
Now, Mr. Baker, you've come, haven't you, in answer to my advertisement? Er, is this your hat?
===
This? Oh, yes, sir, undoubtedly.
Then pray allow me to return it to you with my compliments. The bird, I am afraid, we've been compelled to eat.
===
Careful - careful, Mr. Baker. You'll - you'll spill your drink.
It was quite a necessity, I'm afraid, since in these modern days we seem to have lost the art of refrigeration in which our Elizabethan ancestors were so adept. However, there's this other bird here on the sideboard to which you're extremely welcome as a replacement.
===
That's uncommonly kind of you, sir.
Not at all. Of course, er, we still have the feathers and the crop of your own bird, if you'd like to take them, too.
===
Not at all, sir. I'm a member of a Christmas goose club run by the landlord at the Alpha Inn near the Museum.
The Alpha Inn, Watson.
===
Yes, yes. I really am most grateful to you for your kindness, sir. I was set on by some roughs in the street and I - I lost it.
All's well that ends well, Mr. Baker. We were fortunate enough to find it, so-- Here's your hat.
===
Thank you.
And here is your new bird. Oh, I've put the old ticket onto it -- the one that was tied to the other goose's leg -- marked "To Mrs. Henry Baker."
===
Oh, how nice of you. I - I'm much obliged, sir.
Well, not at all. A peace offering, Mr. Baker?
===
A peace offering, sir, in point of fact -- to my better half.
Ah, quite.
===
Good night.
Good night, Mr. Baker.
===
CHILDREN SING "O COME, ALL YE FAITHFUL" ... FADES IN DURING FOLLOWING ... THEN IN BG--
Well, well, well. So much for Mr. Henry Baker, Watson.
===
It's quite evident that he was innocent, of course, from the trap you laid -- I mean, about the feathers and the crop.
Yes, evident. I suggest, Watson, that we turn that proposed dinner of ours into a late supper. I'll tell Mrs. Hudson -- she'll forgive us -- and in the meanwhile let's follow up the clew of the Alpha Inn.
===
By all means, Holmes. I confess I'm most intrigued.
Yes, I'm afraid we shall have to battle our way out through those infernal waifs who are making night so hideous on our humble doorstep. Come, Watson -- we've work to do this Christmas Eve.
===
Yes! Here's the market, Holmes. What was the name of the goose dealer?
Breckinridge, Watson. Here, there it is -- you see? The largest stall of the lot. There's the name written up over it.
===
Yes! Just in time: they're closing up. Hmmm! Horsy-looking fella, isn't he?
What's that you say? Horsy? Good for you, Watson. That fact might come in useful. Ah, good evening, Mr. Breckinridge. Mm, it's a cold night.
===
Yeah, cold enough, I reckon. Glad to get finished.
Sold out of geese, I see.
===
Let you have five hundred tomorrow morning.
Ah, that's no good, I'm afraid. We want one tonight.
===
By the landlord of the Alpha Inn in Bloomsbury.
Yes, you supplied him with some incomparable birds, he told us. Where did you get them from, by the way?
===
Now look here! What exactly are you drivin' at, mister?
Why, nothing, only that I wanted to know who sold you those geese.
===
I'm dashed if I'll tell you, then! You're another one to pester me, are ya?
Another one? What do you mean?
===
When I pay good money for a thing, that should be the end of it I say. But it's "where are those geese?" and "who did you sell those geese to?" till I'm sick of it! You'd think that lot were the only geese in the world the way some folk keep on at me about 'em!
Well, I can assure you that we've nothing to do with any other people who've been making inquiries, Mr. Breckinridge. In fact, all I'm concerned with-- --is a little bet I've made.
===
A bet?
Just so. I'm always ready to back my opinion and I bet a fiver with my friend the doctor here that the bird we et from the Alpha Inn was country bred.
===
You've lost your fiver then, 'cause it was town bred.
No-no-no, it was nothing of the kind.
===
It was, I tell you! Cor, do you think you know more about fowls than I do when I've been in the trade, man and boy, for--?
I tell you, it's country bred.
===
It's town! Here, will you take a bet with me, too?
With pleasure. A sovereign. Every penny of it.
===
That's the list of the folk I buy from, see? And what I do with the stuff when I've bought it. Now then, look at that line there. Do you see?
Can you see it, Watson, in this light?
===
Right! And so what do you say now, Mr. Bloomin' Poultry Fancier?!
Well, I must say, I could have sworn it was country bred. All right, you win, Mr. Breckinridge.
===
Thank you.
Come along, doctor. I owe you five, I think.
===
Easy money, that's what I say! Haha! Well, good evening, gents! A merry Christmas to ye!
Good evening, Mr. Breckinridge. Well, Watson, let's stand here by the gas lamp for a moment. I want to think.
===
There's some kind of a quarrel, Holmes, back there at Breckinridge's stall.
Oh, yes. So there is. Let's see what's the matter.
===
You want me to collar him?
Stand by if he gets nasty. He looks a bit of a shrimp, though; not much trouble. Here, my man! Not so fast. I'd just like a word with you.
===
What? Here, who are you? What do you want?
I couldn't help overhearing your little disagreement with the good salesman over there, and I think I might be able to assist you.
===
How do you mean? How could you know anything? Who are you, eh?
My name is Sherlock Holmes, and it's my business to know what other people don't know.
===
Well, you can't know anything about this.
On the contrary. You're trying to trace some geese, which were sold by a Mrs. Oakshott, to that man there, who sold them to the landlord of the Alpha Inn, who got rid of them through his goose club, of which Mr. Henry Baker is a member.
===
What?! Why, you're the very man I've been looking for, Mr. Holmes. Oh, I can hardly tell you how much it means to me.
Watson, be good enough to signal for a four-wheeler, will you?
===
Yes, certainly. Cabbie!
I think, my friend, we'd better discuss this whole matter in some cozy place rather than in the crowded street. We'll go to my room, shall we? Oh, what's your name, may I ask?
===
My name's, er, Robinson. John Robinson.
No-no-no, the real name. It's always so awkward doing business with an alias.
===
All right then. James Ryder.
Ah! Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan, I believe.
===
Yeh.
Quite so. You have the cab, Watson?
===
Just coming over, Holmes.
Splendid, splendid. Now, would you mind just standing on Mr. Ryder's other side and, er-- --just take him by the arm, will you? He might have a fancy to go for a little walk.
===
I'll make some more punch I think, Holmes. We could all do with a warming.
Thank you, Watson, if you will! You'll find the lemons behind you on the gasogene stand.
===
And the nutmeg scraper?
There, behind the Persian slipper. Oh, you might hand it to me, will you, dear fellow? I'd like some tobacco.
===
Certainly.
Thank you so much. Well now, Mr. Ryder--
===
Yes, sir?
You, er-- You want to know what became of those geese, Mr. Ryder -- or rather of that goose, for I fancy it was only one that you were interested in: a white one with a black bar across its tail.
===
Oh, if you could only tell me, sir, I'd be that grateful. It's really mine, you see, sir. It was sold by mistake.
And a most remarkable bird, if I may say so, Mr. Ryder. Watson, hand me over my strong-box, if you please.
===
What?
The bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen. I have it here.
===
Cor, merciful heaven!
The game's up, Ryder.
===
Steady, man, steady -- or you'll be in the fire.
Hang on to him, Watson!
===
It's all right, Holmes, I've got him. Almost fainting, poor devil. I'll get him a brandy.
Poor devil, hey? Heavens, what a worm the fellow is. He's not got blood enough to go in for felony.
===
Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. Ohhhh, what have I done? What have I done?
You know perfectly well what you've done, Ryder. It only needs one or two more links, Watson, to make the case complete. Now then, Ryder, who told you of the Countess of Morcar's jewel, the blue carbuncle?
===
The countess's waiting-maid, Holmes!
Exactly. And so you invented some excuse to send that unfortunate young Horner into the countess's hotel room -- and after he was gone, you rifled the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and put the blame onto him.
===
Yes, sir, I did, sir.
Ah.
===
Oh, for heaven's sake, have mercy, Mr. Holmes. I - I never went wrong before. It was Cathy was to blame! Please, sir--
Get up off the floor, man! It's no good kneeling to me. You didn't show much mercy to Horner, did you?
===
I - I'll leave the country, sir. The charge will break down against him.
Get up. Get up! Watson, help him onto his feet, for heaven's sake.
===
Well, it - it was all a mistake, you see, sir. Once I had it, I wanted to hide it somewhere. It seemed to burn a hole in me pocket. So I went to my sister's, you see, to think things out--
Your sister?
===
Maggie. She married a man called Oakshott.
Aha.
===
Well, I was thinking it out in our yard, see -- smokin' a pipe like -- and I remembered that Maggie had promised me a bird for Christmas, so-- Well, I had an idea.
Ah, you forced the stone down the bird's throat.
===
Ah! Well, what are you going to do, Holmes?
I'm not quite sure, but I think, all things considered, it might be best to--
===
What? You mean--?
I mean get out, man!
===
Oh, heaven bless you, Mr. Holmes!
I don't want to hear any more from you; get out.
===
Oh, thank you, Mr. Holmes--
Get out!
===
Ah, my dear Holmes, shouldn't you have turned him in?
Well, when all is said and done, Watson, I'm really not retained by the police to supplement their deficiencies. As soon as I send the stone back, the case against Horner will collapse at once. There'll be no witness.
===
But you're committing a felony, you know.
Well, it's just possible that I'm also saving a soul. I don't believe he'll go wrong again. He's too scared. Besides, Watson--
===
What?
Well, this is the season of forgiveness, man. Listen. Twelve o'clock! It's Christmas Day. Oh, pass me some of that delicious punch of yours, won't you? And tell me you forgive me, too.
===
MANY JOYOUS RINGING CHURCH BELLS JOIN THE CHIMING ... THEN CONTINUE IN BG
For being so surly yesterday morning when you offered me the compliments of the season. I return them now with all my heart. And here's your health, old friend, with my glass upraised. A merry Christmas, my dear Watson.
===
A merry Christmas, Holmes!
God save her gracious Majesty.
===
"--John Straker, the trainer, lived in a small villa about two hundred yards from the stables."
I see you have some newspapers there, Watson. Let's see what they have to say about the matter.
===
"The boy ran to unleash the dog and the maid hurried towards the house. But, looking back, she saw the stranger leaning in through the stable window. A minute later when Hunter rushed out with the dog, the stranger was gone." Yes, um-- That's as far as we can get with the Morning Post, I'm afraid. Mrs. Hudson very stupidly used the other half of the paper to light the fire this morning. I - I'm sorry.
Oh, no matter, my dear fellow; the Telegraph has also covered the occurrence very fully. I have it here.
===
Hunter had obviously being drugged! 
Undoubtedly. "Mrs. Straker and the maid left him and ran up to the moor to see whether Straker had merely taken the horse out for exercise. And so the murder was discovered." Suppose you read me the rest of Mrs. Straker's statement.
===
Oh. Well-- Yes, here it is. Er-- "Some quarter of a mile from the stables Mrs. Straker and the maid found Straker's coat flapping from a furze-bush. Immediately beyond, there was a bowl-shaped depression on the moor, and at the bottom of this John Straker's body was found -- his head shattered by a savage blow from some heavy weapon; wounded in the thigh, a long clean cut evidently inflicted by some sharp instrument. Straker had obviously tried to defend himself, for in his left hand he grasped a red and black silk cravat which was recognized by the maid as having been worn by the stranger who'd spoken to her outside the stables. Hunter, the stable boy, also identified it when he'd recovered from the effects of the drug. This was apparently powdered opium which had been put into his curried mutton." Now that - that explains what the stranger was doing as he leant through the stable window--
Mm hm.
===
--for the lads who et the same meal at the trainer's house were quite all right, so only one plate had been drugged. It goes on to say there were abundant proofs in the mud which lay at the bottom of the fatal hollow that the missing horse, Silver Blaze, had been there at the time of the struggle. 
Well, Watson, that has passed our little journey quite agreeably. And here we are at Tavistock. 
===
I'm delighted that you've come down, Mr. Holmes. The inspector here has done all that could possibly be suggested, but I wish to leave no stone unturned in trying to avenge poor Straker and recover my horse.
I trust that I may be able to assist you, sir. Has there been any fresh development?
===
Of course Straker himself was wounded, wasn't he? In the thigh. He may have wounded himself in the convulsive struggles which follow any brain injury. 
Excellent, my dear Watson. It's more than possible; it's probable. In which case one of the main points in favor of the accused disappears. 
===
He says it was a ten-pound note, and one was found in his purse. Also, he's not a stranger to the district; he's twice lodged at Tavistock in the summer. The opium he probably brought with him from London. The key, having served its term, will be hurled away. As for the horse, he may well lie at the bottom of one of the pits or old mines upon the moor.
What does he say about the cravat?
===
He admits that it's his and says that he lost it. But a new element has been introduced into the case which may account for his leading the horse from the stables. We found traces that show that a party of gypsies encamped on Monday night within a mile of the spot where the murder took place. On Tuesday they were gone. Simpson may well have been leading the horse to them when he was overtaken.
Mmm, it's certainly possible. 
===
Eh, the moor is being scoured for them. Meanwhile I've examined every stable and outhouse in Tavistock and for a radius of ten miles. 
There's another training stable quite close, I believe. 
===
Yes, and that's a factor we must certainly not neglect. As Desborough, their horse, was second in the betting, they had an interest in the disappearance of Silver Blaze. Silas Brown, their trainer, is known to have had large bets upon the event and he was no friend to poor Straker. However, we've examined his stables and there's nothing to connect him with the affair.
And nothing to connect Fitzroy Simpson with their interests?
===
Our driver pulled up at a little red-brick villa which stood by the road. Colonel Ross asked Holmes whether he would like to go on to the scene of the crime.
No, I think I prefer to stay here a little while and go into one or two questions of detail. Straker was brought back here, I suppose. 
===
Yes, he lies upstairs. The inquest is tomorrow.
He's been in your service some years, Colonel? 
===
I've always found him an excellent servant. 
I presume that you made an inventory of what he had in his pockets at the time of his death, Inspector? 
===
I have the things themselves here in the sitting room. 
Aha.
===
Here they are. A box of matches, two inches of tallow candle, pencil case, a few papers, and the ivory-handled knife. 
Yea. A very singular knife, Watson. Surely in your line.
===
It's what we call a cataract knife. We use it for surgical purposes, including very delicate operations. 
A strange thing for a man to carry with him on a rough expedition. Why, it won't even shut up to go into his pocket.
===
Er, the tip was guarded by a cork which we found beside his body. His wife tells us that he kept it for some days on the dressing table and picked it up as he left the room. A poor weapon, but perhaps the best he could lay his hands on at the moment. 
And the papers? 
===
Hay-dealers' accounts. This letter from Colonel Ross. And this dressmaker's account for thirty-seven pounds fifteen, made out by Madame Lesurier of Bond Street. 
May I see that bill, please? 
===
Certainly. It's made out to William Derbyshire. 
William Derbyshire? 
===
Mrs. Straker tells us he was a friend of her husband's and that occasionally letters for him were addressed here. 
Had he been staying here then? Did Mrs. Straker know him? 
===
How do you do, sir? 
How do you do, Mrs. Straker? Surely we've met before. At a garden party in Plymouth recently. 
===
No, sir. You must be mistaken.
Dear me, I could have sworn it. You wore a costume of dove-colored silk with ostrich feather trimmings. 
===
Never had such a dress, sir. 
Oh. Well, that settles it then. 
===
If you'll excuse me, sir, I'd like a word with the colonel. 
Of course.
===
Holmes, I believe you've got your hand on a clue. 
Oh, do you? As a matter of fact, I was just remembering a really excellent curry we once et together in Soho.
===
None; but very heavy rain.
Well, in that case the coat was not blown against the furze-bushes. It must have been placed there. 
===
Yes, it was laid across the bush.
Very interesting.
===
In this bag I have one of the boots which Straker wore, one of Fitzroy Simpson's shoes, and a cast horseshoe of Silver Blaze.
My dear Inspector, you surpass yourself.
===
Holmes took the bag and, descending into the hollow, he made a careful study of the trampled mud in front of him.
Hullo! What's this? A spent match, eh? Excellent. 
===
I can't think how I came to miss it!
It was invisible; buried in the mud. I only found it because I was looking for it. 
===
What? You expected to find it?
I thought it not unlikely. You'll have searched the ferns around the rim of the hollow for any more tracks, of course. 
===
I'm afraid there are none. I've examined the ground very carefully for a hundred yards in each direction.
Good. Then I'll take a little walk over the moors before it grows dark, and I think I'll put this horseshoe in my pocket - just for luck. 
===
I - I suppose you know your own methods best, Mr. Holmes. Perhaps you'll come back with me, Inspector. There are several matters on which I need your advice. Especially as to whether we owe it to the public to scratch Silver Blaze from the Wessex Cup.
Certainly not, Colonel! I should let the name stand. 
===
Almost anywhere on Dartmoor I should imagine. 
Oh, dear, no. The horse is a gregarious animal. If left to himself, his instincts would have been either to return to King's Pyland or go on over to Capleton yonder. Why should he run wild upon the moor? As he's not at King's Pyland, he must be over there - at Capleton! Come along. 
===
We don't want any loiterers around here! 
I only wanted to ask you a question. Would I be too early to see your master, Mr. Silas Brown, if I were to call here at five o'clock tomorrow morning? 
===
What's this, Dawson? No gossiping! Go on about your business! And you there! What the devil do you want here?!
Ten minutes talk with you, my good sir. 
===
Well, I've no time to talk to every gadabout. And we don't want strangers here. Be off, or you may find a dog at your heels.
One word in your ear, my friend. In your own interest.
===
It's a lie! An infernal lie!
Very good. Shall we argue about it here in public or talk it over in your parlor? Or do I go to the police? 
===
It shall be done, sir, just as you wish it.
There must be no mistake. 
===
Oh, no, there shall be no mistake. It shall be there. Should I change it first or not? 
No, no, don't. I'll write to you about that. No tricks now!
===
Oh, no -- you can trust me. You can trust me.
Yes, I think I can. Well, you shall hear from me tomorrow. Good day to you. 
===
He has the horse, then?
Oh, he tried to bluster it out, but I told him so exactly what his actions had been that morning that he's convinced I was actually watching him. He was first down as usual and, seeing a strange horse wandering on the moor, he went out to it. When he recognized it as Silver Blaze -- from the white splash on its forehead -- his first instinct was to return it to the King's Pyland stable, which he set out to do. But then he realized that if the horse could only be hidden till after the Wessex Cup, his own horse Desborough would almost certainly win, so he changed his mind and turned back halfway; brought Silver Blaze down to his own stables.
===
But I thought his stables had been thoroughly searched. 
Oh, an old horse-fakir like him has many a dodge.
===
Ah, but aren't you afraid to leave the horse in his power now, since he has every interest in injuring it?
My dear fellow, he'll guard it like the apple of his eye. He knows that his only hope of mercy is to produce it safely at the racetrack for the Wessex Cup. I made that perfectly clear to him. But I have a little trick to play on Colonel Ross. You may have noticed that his manner to me was just a trifle cavalier. So neither of us, please, for the present will say anything to him about the horse.
===
Well, certainly not, if you wish it. 
And of course this is all quite a minor matter compared with the question of who killed John Straker.
===
And you will devote yourself to that in the meantime? 
On the contrary. We'll both go back to London by the night train. 
===
I was thunderstruck by my friend's words. We'd only been a few hours in Devonshire. That he should give up an investigation which he had begun so brilliantly was quite incomprehensible to me. Not one word more could I draw from him until we were back at the trainer's house where the colonel and the inspector were waiting for us.
My friend and I return to town by the midnight-express. We've had a charming little breath of your Dartmoor air. 
===
So you despair of arresting the murderer of poor Straker? 
There are certainly grave difficulties in the way. I have every hope, however, that your horse will be at the race track next Tuesday and I beg that you will have your jockey in readiness. Oh, may I take this photograph of John Straker with me back to town? 
===
We went outside.
Goodbye. Goodbye, colonel! I hope to see you at the Wessex Cup -- and Silver Blaze. [Goodbye, Inspector.
===
But, Mr. Holmes, isn't there any point to which you would wish to draw my attention?
To the curious incident of the dog in the night-time.
===
The dog did nothing in the night-time.
That was the curious incident.]
===
Four days later Holmes and I saw Silver Blaze win the Wessex Cup by a good six lengths. But it was not a Silver Blaze that even its owner could recognize. There was no trace to be seen of the famous white splash on its forehead, or of the mottled off-foreleg. The Silver Blaze that won the Wessex Cup was a powerful bay. It was only in the weighing enclosure after the race that Holmes began to explain -- to a colonel who was completely bewildered.
You've only to wash his face and his leg in spirits of wine and you will find that he's just the same old Silver Blaze as ever.
===
You - you take my breath away.
Yes, I found him in the hands of a fakir, and took the liberty of running him just as he was sent over. 
===
My dear sir, you've done wonders! I owe you a thousand apologies! You've done me a very great service by recovering my horse. You would do me a greater still if you could lay your hands on the murderer of John Straker. 
I have done so.
===
What--? 
He's in our company at the present moment.
===
That is either a very bad joke, Mr. Holmes-- Or is it an insult?
I am not referring to you, Colonel. The real murderer is standing immediately before you.
===
The horse?! 
Yes, the horse. Silver Blaze himself. It may lessen the guilt somewhat if I say that the killing was done entirely in self-defense and that John Straker was a man who was quite unworthy of your confidence.
===
You mean when you mentioned our Soho meal? 
Exactly. Powdered opium has a disagreeable and perceptible flavor. Only something more strongly flavored -- like a curry -- could have disguised the taste. Now, Fitzroy Simpson could never have known that the maid would be serving the stable lad with a curry that night. The only people who could have known that were people in the house. So who could have taken advantage of the fact? Then there was the silence of the dog when the horse was taken from the stable. It failed to bark because it knew who the intruder was. I was already quite convinced that the intruder must have been John Straker himself. 
===
But why did he wish to take Silver Blaze out onto the moor in the dead of night, and secretly? 
The answer to that was in John Straker's pocket. 
===
The dressmaker's bill? 
Precisely. Addressed to William Derbyshire. That set me thinking. Perhaps John Straker was leading a double life. After all, his wife confirmed that the expensive costume wasn't for her, and by recognizing the photo that I showed her, Madame Lesurier, the dressmaker, later confirmed that John Straker had indeed bought it there -- to give to a woman of more expensive tastes than his wife.
===
John Straker?! I can scarcely believe it! 
The knife gave me the final clue. It was a surgical knife -- such as could be used to lame a horse without leaving any visible evidence of foul play. By laming Silver Blaze and betting on Desborough, John Straker would have been able to retrieve his fortune.
===
Oh, the scoundrel! A man I trusted! 
He led the horse out onto the moor so that when he cut its tendon its plunging wouldn't waken the grooms overhead. In order that he could see what he was going to do, he needed a candle. So that the candle should not be seen, he led the horse to the hollow. In lighting the candle, he dropped that spent match in the mud. Unfortunately for him, the light must have scared the horse -- unless it was instinct. Whichever it was, the horse lashed out and its steel shoe caught Straker full in the forehead. He'd already taken off his mackintosh to be freer -- and, as he fell, gashed his thigh on his own knife. 
===
And the cravat? Fitzroy Simpson's, which was in the dead man's hand. 
Simpson said that he lost it; no doubt he did. Straker must have found it and picked it up, perhaps with the idea of using it to secure the horse's leg. Well, that disposes of everything. Quite simple. Perhaps we could while away the rest of this journey, my dear Watson, with a game of chess. 
===
No. No, thanks, old fellow; I'll stick to my pipe.
Flying Scotsman's living up to its name. We're going splendidly. Our present rate is fifty-three-and-a-half miles an hour.
===
Oh? I hadn't noticed the quarter mile posts.
Nor have I, but the telegraph posts on this line are sixty yards apart. With the aid of a watch the calculation is a simple one. Watson, my dear fellow, we have several hours ahead of us. Tell me more about Sir Walter Dunbar. I have a feeling that he is in some kind of trouble, and that you haven't wanted to talk about it.
===
Well, it's not exactly trouble, Holmes, but there's a strange problem that confronts the Dunbars. A problem that'll be settled at midnight tomorrow.
Oh, indeed? The night of New Year's Eve, eh?
===
Yes, exactly. But to really appreciate the story, I have to begin by telling you of the death of old Sir Thomas Dunbar. 
The father of the present baronet, I suppose.
===
Exactly.
And the first baronet was a friend of Sir Walter Scott, while his son can boast of your acquaintance. Why, it's a family singularly rich in literary friendships.
===
That's not very funny, Holmes. But to continue, I suppose you can guess what happened. Sir Thomas carefully drew up the document to specify the New Year's Eve before the baronet's 21st birthday. And the poor child was born on February the 29th. It was a leap year.
So poor Sir Walter is still waiting for his iron box full of gold.
===
Yes. He'll be eighty-four next year and yet, legally, with only one birthday every four years -- in the eyes of the law -- he'll at last be twenty-one!
A most amusing situation, though I'm afraid Sir Walter finds it far from entertaining. The lawyers must have been extremely scrupulous in abiding by the letter of the document.
===
Yes. Old Sandy Murdock is dead now, of course, but he too has a great-grandson, William Murdock, who still handles the Dunbar estate. He'll be at the castle tonight to formally hand over the iron box.
I'm delighted you accepted the holiday invitation of Sir Walter, my dear fellow. I've needed a rest, but I've always loathed too strict a one. This situation may pose a nice little problem for me.
===
Problem?
Yes, I'm reasonably certain that the agèd Sir Walter Dunbar will not get his iron box full of gold on this New Year's Eve, either. But we shall see, old fellow; we shall see.
===
Thank you, my boy. Holmes, this is Ian Dunbar, Sir Walter's grandson.
How do you do, Mr. Dunbar?
===
Thank the Lord I had the foresight to be born on the prosaic date of August the twenty-first.
In the event of your grandfather's death, you would be the next baronet, I take it?
===
Dorothy Small. She and her father are staying here, too.
My congratulations.
===
How do you do?
How do you do, Miss Small?
===
Watson, me dear boy! How are ye? And this must be your friend, Sherlock Holmes.
How do you do, Sir Walter?
===
Very well, for a young nipper who'll be twenty-one at midnight. Oh, gentlemen, may I introduce Mr. Herbert Small?
How do you do?
===
Oh, any moment, Herbert. As soon as he arrives we'll have dinner and then we'll be ready for the evening's ceremonies.
He's bringing the famous iron box with him, Sir Walter?
===
I must say that this is rather exciting, Holmes. The famous iron box with its inheritance of gold.
Yes, and from the size of the box, at a rough guess, I should estimate its cubic content in gold at around five thousand pounds. Not a vast sum, perhaps, to a business man like Mr. Small, but a windfall to an impecunious Scottish baronet.
===
Yes, I suppose it is.
A strong young man, Mr. Murdock.
===
How do you mean "strong," Holmes?
A box that size full of golden sovereigns would weigh a considerable amount, and yet the lawyer carried it single-handed.
===
I think Mr. Small may be right. What do you say, Mr. Holmes, do you know?
Well, I hoped no one would bring up this point, but-- Heh! It's the little problem I referred to on the train, my dear Watson.
===
Holmes! For Heavens sake, answer! Is Nineteen Hundred a leap year or no?
I'm afraid it's not, Sir Walter.
===
Mr. Holmes, are you sure of your facts?
I'm very much afraid that I am, young man.
===
Oh, what a miserable meal, Holmes. Sir Walter's gone to his room, the young lovers are nearly in tears, and Small and the lawyer Murdock seem to be positively gloating.
Yes, a most depressing atmosphere in which to welcome the new year. But let us, at least, make the best of it. I think I'll go and have a talk with Sir Walter. And you, my dear chap, why not try and cheer up the young folks? Some of your experiences in India may help them take their minds off their troubles.
===
Holmes? What is it? What's wrong?
The devil's work afoot, Watson. Come with me, old fellow; and you, Mr. Dunbar.
===
Mr. Holmes, what's happened?
It's Sir Walter. I went to his room. It was in darkness, but in the moonlight I saw two figures struggling by the open casement. One of them was Sir Walter. As I entered he disappeared from sight. His attacker had pushed him out of the window into the moat.
===
How dreadful! 
The other man got away in the darkness. We must get lanterns and go out to the moat at once. Though I'm very much afraid, Mr. Dunbar, that your grandfather is beyond our help!
===
Can you see anything, Holmes?
Not a thing.
===
Well, Holmes? Have - have you given up hope?
I'm afraid we'll never find him without dragnets and grappling hooks. Have to call the police. What time is it? Sir Ian? Do you know the time?
===
What did you call me, Mr. Holmes?
Sir Ian.
===
By Jove, yes! It does seem a bit premature, Holmes, but of course you're right! If your poor grandfather's dead, Mr. Dunbar, you're the baronet now!
And the time, Sir Ian?
===
It's - it's a quarter to twelve, Mr. Holmes. 
A quarter of an hour to the new year. Sir Ian, doesn't that fact suggest something to you?
===
What's he brought us all back here for, Holmes? Something very funny going on. I tell you, I don't like the look of it. 
And I, Watson, like the look of it very much. 
===
I wish you wouldn't be so dashed mysterious. What are you up to? You haven't taken a step yet towards finding the murderer.
Haven't I? [X] And I wonder what causes the beads of perspiration on Mr. Small's brow.
===
Small? You mean that Small--?
And I wonder what causes the singular look of apprehension on the face of Murdock, the young lawyer. You remember, of course, on my remarking how easily he carried the large iron box.
===
Great Scott, yes. And it took a strong man to throw Sir Walter out of the window!
Ssh, Watson. 
===
Huh?
The new year is approaching. 
===
Ian darling, how frightfully clever of you.
Good lad. I'd hoped he'd think of it.
===
You--! You--!
Gentlemen, gentlemen, please.
===
Upon my soul, Holmes. You seem remarkably calm. 
Do I, my dear Watson? I must say, I am absolutely fascinated by listening to three people accusing each other of murder -- and each of them producing perfectly sound motives. It's a remarkable example of the dangers of reasoning from motive alone. We should profit by experience, Watson. 
===
Mr. Holmes, how can you be so calm? There's a murderer in this room!
I suppose this game of charades is getting a little out of hand, Miss Small. Let's conclude it. You'd better come out now!
===
You tell him, Holmes. I fancy a wee drop of Creme of Dunbar. Watching you all search for my body in the moat has made me thirsty!
The explanation is a very simple one, ladies and gentlemen. When you arrived here tonight, Mr. Murdock, I knew from the way you handled the box that it could not contain the sum of gold it was supposed to.
===
And so you - you suspected fraud and devised a plan to force the opening of the box, eh?
Yes, and Sir Walter was an eager conspirator. 
===
Of course I was! Ian is twenty-one next August. Supposing - supposing I had died off ere he came of age and before my next birthday four years hence. The box would never have been opened.
And so we invented the fake murder story. By the way, Ian, I must congratulate you for grasping the possibilities of the situation so speedily. If you hadn't demanded the opening of the box, the Murdock secret might still be a secret. 
===
Hm, it was a clever plan, Holmes. Too bad that it had to have such a miserable ending. 
I'm not sure that we have finished with the matter. Mr. Murdock?
===
Yes, Mr. Holmes? 
You say that your family took four thousand pounds from that box?
===
Yes, Mr. Holmes. 
Curious. I would have sworn from its size that it would hold closer to five thousand. And in your account of the legend, Watson, you told me that Sir Thomas Dunbar stated on his deathbed that he had put something else in the box.
===
Yes, yes, yes.
Something for a rainy day, is that it?
===
Yes. Mm-hmm. 
Did the Murdocks find that extra something?
===
No, Mr. Holmes. They found nothing but the gold. 
Now that's very odd. I think I'll take a closer look at that box, if you don't mind.
===
What do you mean, Holmes? 
Permit me to show you all the treasure of the Dunbars. 
===
What have you found, Holmes?
The "something for a rainy day" that old Sir Thomas spoke of. You see, since the
===
A manuscript? 
Quite so. The manuscript of a book. Look at the title page and see the author's name.
===
By Jove, yes, Sir Walter! This is really a happy occasion. 
Then let's complete it -- by singing the traditional song of the season, "Auld Lang Syne." And in this case, when we sing "Should auld acquaintance be forgot," I feel that in, our hearts, we should be thinking of Sir Walter Scott. Though he died over sixty years ago, he's made us all very happy here tonight.
